- **General Information:** The digital assistant is an automated system powered by an LLM. Despite my best efforts, I cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the answers. (In fact, creating an accurate and reliable digital assistant is a rather difficult task where even large companies can fail).
- **Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for your interactions with the digital assistant and any reliance you place on the information provided. It is important that you exercise caution and discretion in interpreting and acting upon the digital assistant's responses. I cannot be held liable for any actions, losses or damages resulting from the use of my digital assistant.
- **Privacy and Security:** Please be aware that conversations are logged and may be reviewed by me to improve the responses of the digital assistant. Also, the LLM API provider ([Groq](https://groq.com/)) of the Model API may use parts of your conversation. Do not include sensitive information in your conversations, which you would not want to share with others.
