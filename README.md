## Dataset

The raw data used to build the RAG knowledge base is stored in `data/blog_posts/json`. It consists of all blog posts from [https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/](https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/) (as of 28.08.2024). See the `notebooks/web_scraping.ipynb` notebook for more technical details on the web scraping process.

## Technologies

The chatbot was build with the following technologies:

- Web Scraping: [Beautiful Soup Library](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

- Text embeddings: pre-trained model [`multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1) of the [Sentence Transformers Library](https://www.sbert.net/index.html)
  - build with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/)'s [Transformers Library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
  - It was "tuned for semantic search: Given a query/question, it can find relevant passages. It was trained on a large and diverse set of (question, answer) pairs."
