(URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/were-we-wrong-about-fiber/):\\n\\t- In my video Is the Fiber Theory Wrong?, I present that fiber-containing foods may not only help prevent heart disease, but also help treat it as well. Heart patients who increase their intake of fiber after their first heart attack reduce their risk of a second and live longer than those who don't. But what if we don't want to have a heart attack in the first place? If 7 grams of fiber gets us a 9 percent reduced risk, would 77 grams a day drop our risk by 99 percent? That's about how much fiber they used to eat in Uganda, a country in which coronary heart disease, our number-one killer, was almost nonexistent. Heart disease was so rare among those eating traditional plant-based diets in Uganda that papers were published with such titles as 'A Case of Coronary Heart Disease in an African.' After 26 years of medical practice in East Africa, doctors finally recorded their first case of coronary heart disease (in a judge who consumed a 'partially Westernized diet,' in which fiber-free\\n3. Title 'Why Donâ€™t More Doctors Practice Prevention?' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/why-dont-more-doctors-practice-prevention/):\\n\\t- ing to the Director of the famous Framingham Heart Study (highlighted in my video, Barriers to Heart Disease Prevention), the best way to manage coronary artery disease is to lower patients' LDL cholesterol and other atherosclerosis-causing particles. 'You can achieve this with diet plus drugs, but if you can do it with a vegetarian diet, it works even better.' In the Framingham Heart Study, those running in the Boston Marathon achieved the goal of getting their total to good cholesterol ratio under four, but the vegetarians did even better. And if you go all out, putting people on a very high fiber, whole-food vegetable, fruit, and nut diet, you can get a 25 percent drop in the bad to good cholesterol ratio within one week and a 33 percent drop in LDL. That's the cholesterol-reduction equivalent to a therapeutic dose of a cholesterol-lowering statin drug. Dr. Ornish talks about how diet can be more sustainable than drugs, since compliance is more based on love-of-life rather than\\n4.

Title 'Moderation Kills' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/moderation-kills/):\\n\\t- What if we don't want just low risk for a heart attack, but no risk? One great stumbling block has been that government and national health organizations appear to have taken the patronizing view that the public can't handle the truth and would rather the science be watered down. However, as Dr. Esselstyn wrote in the Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine, in regard to cholesterol lowering, moderation kills. 'Even if all Americans kept their total cholesterol below 200 mg/dL, as recommended by the American Heart Association, millions would develop coronary artery disease.' Strong evidence shows we need to keep our total cholesterol under 150 mg/dL in order to stem the American epidemic of coronary artery disease, our number-one killer. What kind of evidence? In many cultures, coronary artery disease is practically unheard of when total serum cholesterol levels are under 150 mg/dL. In the United States, the famous Framingham Heart Study demonstrated that few of those with levels below\\n\\n</context>\\n\"},\n",
