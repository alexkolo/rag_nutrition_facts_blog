First, you can make lifestyle changes that can lower your risk by 90%, including changing your diet, losing weight, and exercising. These changes are more effective than taking drugs, which usually only reduce the risk by 20-30%. You can learn more about how to do this by watching my video, \"How Not to Die from Heart Disease.\"\n",
