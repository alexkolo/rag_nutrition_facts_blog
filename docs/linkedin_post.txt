As a Data Scientist specializing in Generative AI, I built this to tackle the growing issue of misinformation in health 🌍. With science-backed resources from NUTRITIONFACTS.ORG, this chatbot serves as a reliable digital assistant, offering fact-based and accessible guidance on nutrition and well-being💡.


Was it a challenge to pull this off in such a short time? 💥 Absolutely. But it was also an incredibly rewarding opportunity to showcase my ability to apply advanced AI techniques to real-world problems that make a difference 🌱.
