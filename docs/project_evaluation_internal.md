03/09/2024: Total: 16 / 23 points (~70%)

- ‚úÖ Problem description
  - [ ] 0 points: The problem is not described
  - [ ] 1 point: The problem is described but briefly or unclearly
  - [x] 2 points: The problem is well-described and it's clear what problem the project solves

- ‚úÖ RAG flow
  - [ ] 0 points: No knowledge base or LLM is used
  - [ ] 1 point: No knowledge base is used, and the LLM is queried directly
  - [x] 2 points: Both a knowledge base and an LLM are used in the RAG flow

- ‚ùó Retrieval evaluation: TODO
  - [x] 0 points: No evaluation of retrieval is provided
  - [ ] 1 point: Only one retrieval approach is evaluated
  - [ ] 2 points: Multiple retrieval approaches are evaluated, and the best one is used

- ‚ùó RAG evaluation: TODO
  - [x] 0 points: No evaluation of RAG is provided
  - [ ] 1 point: Only one RAG approach (e.g., one prompt) is evaluated
  - [ ] 2 points: Multiple RAG approaches are evaluated, and the best one is used

- ‚úÖ Interface
  - [ ] 0 points: No way to interact with the application at all
  - [ ] 1 point: Command line interface, a script, or a Jupyter notebook
  - [x] 2 points: UI (e.g., Streamlit), ~~web application (e.g., Django), or an API (e.g., built with FastAPI)~~

- ‚úÖ Ingestion pipeline
  - [ ] 0 points: No ingestion
  - [ ] 1 point: Semi-automated ingestion of the dataset into the knowledge base, e.g., with a Jupyter notebook
  - [x] 2 points: Automated ingestion with a **Python script** ~~or a special tool (e.g., Mage, dlt, Airflow, Prefect)~~

- üöß Monitoring: IMPROVE
  - [ ] 0 points: No monitoring
  - [x] 1 point: User feedback is collected ~~OR there's a monitoring dashboard~~
  - [ ] 2 points: User feedback is collected and there's a dashboard with at least 5 charts

- ‚úÖ Containerization:
  - [ ] 0 points: No containerization
  - [ ] 1 point: Dockerfile is provided for the main application OR there's a docker-compose for the dependencies only
  - [x] 2 points: Everything is in docker-compose

- üöß Reproducibility: IMPROVE
  - [ ] 0 points: No instructions on how to run the code, the data is missing, or it's unclear how to access it
  - [x] 1 point: Some instructions are provided but are incomplete, OR instructions are clear and complete, the code works, but the data is missing
  - [ ] 2 points: Instructions are clear, the dataset is accessible, it's easy to run the code, and it works. The versions for all dependencies are specified.

- üöß Best practices: IMPROVE
  - [x] Hybrid search: combining both text and vector search (at least evaluating it) (1 point)
  - [x] Document re-ranking (1 point)
  - [ ] User query rewriting (1 point)

- ‚úÖ Bonus points (not covered in the course)
  - [x]  Deployment to the cloud (2 points)
