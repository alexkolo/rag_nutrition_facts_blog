However, the increased risk was seen consistently across the trials, regardless of whether the heart attacks were verified or not. Okay, but why do calcium supplements increase heart attack risk, but the calcium you get in your diet doesn't? Perhaps because when you take calcium pills, you get a spike of calcium in your bloodstream that you don't get from just eating calcium-rich foods. Within hours of taking supplemental calcium, the calcium levels in the blood shoot up and can stay up for as long as eight hours. This evidently produces what's called a hypercoagulable state. That is, your blood clots more easily, which could increase the risk of clots in the heart or brain. Indeed, higher calcium blood levels are tied to higher heart attack and stroke rates. So, the mechanism may be that calcium supplements lead to unnaturally large, rapid, and sustained calcium levels in the\n\t- In 12 short years, government panels have gone from suggesting widespread calcium supplementation may be necessary to protect our bones to 'do not supplement.' What happened? I explore this in my Are Calcium Supplements Safe? video. It all started with a 2008 study in New Zealand. Short-term studies have shown that calcium supplementation may drop blood pressures by about a point. Though the effect appears to be transient, disappearing after a few months, it's better than nothing. Further, excess calcium in the gut can cause fat malabsorption by forming soap fat, reducing saturated fat absorption, and increasing fecal saturated fat content. Indeed, if you take a couple Tums along with your half bucket of KFC, up to twice as much fat could end up in your stool. With less saturated fat absorbed into your system, your cholesterol might drop. Given this, the New Zealand researchers were expecting to lower heart attack rates by giving women calcium supplements.

Those who started calcium supplements suffered significantly more heart attacks or strokes. Thus, high dose or low dose, any calcium supplementation seemed to increase cardiovascular disease risk. Researchers went back, digging through other trial data for heart attack and stroke rates in women randomized to calcium supplements with or without vitamin D added, and they confirmed the danger. Most of the population studies agreed: users of calcium supplements tended to have increased rates of heart disease, stroke, and death. The supplement industry was not happy, accusing researchers of relying in part on self-reported data-that is, simply asking if people had had a heart attack or not, rather than verifying it. In fact, long-term calcium supplementation causes all sorts of gastrointestinal distress, including twice the risk of being hospitalized with acute symptoms that may have been confused with a heart\n2.

Because no lower threshold for estrogenic action has been established, caution should be taken to avoid unnecessary exposure of fetuses and children to exogenous sex steroids, even at very low levels. In the AMA's Pediatrics Journal, the chair of Boston Children's Hospital's Obesity Prevention Center along with the chair of Harvard's nutrition department questioned dairy industry recommendations that children should drink three glasses of milk a day. Dairy milk evolved to promote the growth of grazing animals at high risk for predation when small; so, they needed to put on a few hundred pounds quickly in the first few months of life. The consequences of lifetime human exposure to such growth factors in milk have not been well studied.

The excessive TOR stimulation induced by the standard American diet may initially manifest as premature puberty and acne, but then may later contribute to obesity, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's. A lot of this research is relatively new. Until recently, for example, only a weak association had been accepted for the role of milk and other dairy products in acne formation.  However, there is now substantial evidence supporting the effects of milk and dairy products as enhancers of acne aggravation. Milk is not just food, but appears to represent a most sophisticated hormone signaling system activating TOR, which is of critical concern given that TOR is recognized as the fundamental driving force for a number of serious chronic diseases. If milk is naturally supposed to stimulate TOR, why the problem? Because we're drinking milk from the wrong species. Cow's milk is designed for calves. Baby cows grow\n4.

There was a famous study of 12,000 people that found that a 'person's chances of becoming obese increased by 57%...if he or she had a friend who became obese,' suggesting social ties have a big effect. However, given the evidence implicating the role of gut bacteria in obesity, this 'raises up the possibility that cravings and associated obesity might not just be socially contagious'-that is, because, for instance, you all go out together and eat the same fattening food-'but rather truly infectious, like a cold.'

Even if a healthy diet doesn't help their fibromyalgia symptoms, at least it may prevent them from falling ill with something else. The last thing someone who feels miserable all day needs is another disease. Why do plant-based diets help with chronic pain conditions? There may be a number of reasons why vegetarians only have about half the odds of being on painkiller drugs (see Say No to Drugs by Saying Yes to More Plants). Potentially inflammatory compounds in animal products include Neu5Gc (The Inflammatory Meat Molecule Neu5Gc), and endotoxins (The Exogenous Endotoxin Theory).

Substantial clinical improvements were noted in patients after they ate fava beans, similar to that of receiving a standard drug. Overall, the research is ongoing, and, until we know more, Parkinson's combo drugs like Sinemet should remain the first-line therapy, but adding beans to our diet can only help.

The benefits of honey may be due in part to the phytonutrients from the flowers from which the bees are making the honey, so why not try the flowers directly?

In fact, pain was gone in 92 percent of patients after only one day of treatment. What's more, in most cases, the ulcer was gone completely by the third or fourth day.

By the end of the study, twice as many in the vitamin B12 group appeared to have been cured. The researchers concluded that 'vitamin B12 treatment, which is simple, inexpensive, and low-risk, seems to be effective,' but don't forget that it appeared to take months before it started working. In another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a vitamin B12 ointment applied directly to the canker sores, a significant reduction in pain was demonstrated within only two days compared to placebo, regardless of whether the participant was vitamin B12\u2013deficient or not. Here's a link to the video on the remarkable honey results I mentioned: Flashback Friday: Topical Honey for Canker Sores.

This provides 'strong evidence that [topical] curcumin gel can be used as an effective and safer alternative to steroids in treatment of RAS.' You may remember I've previously discussed that topical honey beat out the same steroid for both ulcer healing and pain reduction, as you can see in the graph and at 2:46 in my video. So, if you're going to use something topically, honey seems better, but what if, instead of a topical application, you just want to swallow something like vitamin C but want something that doesn't give you diarrhea?

Antioxidants typically balance free radical production, but oxidative damage within the body can result from changes in a pro-oxidant direction if free radical concentration gets too high and our antioxidant enzymes and the antioxidants we get from food consumed cannot compensate.

A daily 2,000 mg of vitamin C resulted in 15 out of 16 kids with recurring canker sores cutting the number of ulcers at least in half. After stopping the vitamin C, the canker sores began reappearing and then dropped back down after the C was re-added.

In fact, cases of kwashiorkor-that bloated-belly protein- and calorie-deficient state of malnutrition-due to rice milk have been reported in Ethiopia...and Atlanta, Georgia, because literally 99 percent of the child's diet was rice milk. So, these malnutrition cases were not because they drank rice milk, but rather because they drank rice milk nearly exclusively. I just use these examples to illustrate the relative lack of nutrition in rice milk. If you're going to choose a milk alternative, you might as well go for one that has less arsenic-and more nutrition. I have released several videos on soy milk, but only one on almond milk video so far: Prostate Cancer and Organic Milk vs. Almond Milk.

Title 'Is White Rice a Yellow-Light or Red-Light Food?' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/is-white-rice-a-yellow-light-or-red-light-food/):\n\t- Arsenic is not just considered to be a carcinogen; it's also designated as a 'nonthreshold carcinogen, meaning that any dose, no matter how small, carries some cancer risk'-so there really isn't a 'safe' level of exposure. Given that, it may be reasonable to 'use the conservative ALARA' approach, reducing exposure As Low As Reasonably Achievable. Junk foods made out of brown rice syrup, rice milk, and white rice are not just processed foods, but also arsenic-contaminated processed foods, so they may belong in the red zone as red-light foods we should avoid. What about something like whole brown rice? That is more difficult, because there are pros to help outweigh the cons. I discuss this in my video Is White Rice a Yellow-Light or Red-Light Food?, where you can see a graphical depiction of my traffic light food system at 0:49. The rice industry argues that the 'many health benefits of rice consumption outweigh any potential risk,' which is the same sentiment you hear coming out of\n\t- bout it in my book trailer. Check out How Not to Die: An Animated Summary. Almost there! This is the corresponding article to the 12th in my 13-video series on arsenic in the food supply.

Brown rice averages two-thirds more toxic arsenic than white rice. But, is that just because brown rice tends to be a different strain or grown in different places? No. If you take the exact same batch of brown rice and measure the arsenic levels before and after polishing it to white, you do get a significant drop in arsenic content. It's not what you eat, though. It's what you absorb. The arsenic in brown rice appears to be less bioavailable than the arsenic in white rice. The texture of brown rice may cut down on the release of arsenic from the grain, or perhaps the bran in brown rice helps bind it up. Regardless, taking bioavailability into account, the difference in arsenic levels in white versus brown rice may be a third more, rather than 70 percent more, as you can see at 2:57 in my video. This estimate, however, was based on an in vitro gastrointestinal fluid system in which researchers strung together beakers and tubes to mimic\n\t- Brown rice contains more arsenic than white rice, but the arsenic in brown rice is less absorbable, so how does it wash out when you compare the urine arsenic levels of white-rice eaters to brown-rice eaters? Arsenic in rice is a cause for concern, according to a consensus statement by the European and North American societies for pediatric nutrition. At the very least, 'in areas of the world where rice consumption is high in all ages, authorities should be prompted to declare which of the rice [types] have the lowest arsenic content and are, therefore, the least harmful for use during infancy and childhood.' I look into the arsenic content of different rices in my video Which Rice Has Less Arsenic: Black, Brown, Red, White, or Wild?. Extensive recent testing by the FDA found that long grain white rice, which is what most people eat, appears to have more arsenic than medium or short grain rice, but this may be because most of the shorter grains are produced in California, which has\n\n",

Acne affects nearly one in ten people globally, 'making it the eighth most prevalent disease worldwide.' What is nutrition's role? If we go back a century, dermatology textbooks 'recommended dietary restriction'-for example, advising those with acne to avoid foods like 'pork, sausage, cheese, pickles, pastries, large amounts of sweets, cocoa, and chocolate'-but old-timey medicine was full of crackpot theories. Dr. Kellogg, for example, blamed acne on masturbation. (Nothing a few cornflakes couldn't fix, though!) Population studies have found associations between acne and the consumption of foods like dairy, sweets, and chocolate. You don't know if it's cause and effect, however, until you put it to the test-which they did, as I discuss in my video Does Chocolate Cause Acne?.

The chance of survival benefit of chemo is about one in a hundred, but doctors don't tell patients that. 'Any new chemotherapy drug is still promoted as a major breakthrough in the fight against cancer, only to be quietly rejected without the fanfare that accompanied its arrival.' Indeed, the 'minimal impact on survival in the more common cancers conflicts with the perceptions of many patients who feel they are receiving a treatment that will significantly enhance their chances of cure...In view of the minimal impact of cytotoxic chemotherapy on 5-year survival, and the lack of any major progress over the last 20 years, it follows that the main role of cytotoxic chemotherapy is in palliation.'

Despite a 'major war against cancer,' chemotherapy only contributes about 2 percent to five-year survival in cancer patients. Although chemotherapy treatment is fairly effective for some pediatric cancers, testicular cancer, and Hodgkin's disease, our most common cancers (of the colon, lung, breast, and prostate) only have about a 1 percent success rate, which means, for example, out of about 14,000 colon cancer patients, only 146 live for five years, thanks to chemo.

Chemotherapy can shrink tumors and relieve pain and pressure, but does not tend to result in longer life. Up to 90 to 95 percent of cancers are caused by lifestyle factors, and bad genes are responsible for only 5 to 10 percent. The key to actually winning the war on cancer is prevention, not treatment. A healthy lifestyle can prevent cancer, whereas early diagnosis and treatment-by definition-do not change the cancer rate or number of people getting cancer to begin with. Animal-based foods are associated with increased cancer risk, while plant-based foods are associated with decreased risk. We should get our nutrients from whole, intact plant foods rather than extracts, pills, or supplements.\n2.

Invoking the precautionary principle, the latest science tells us to eat more fruits and vegetables, consume soy products to reduce breast cancer risk and increase chances of survival, and encourages 'limiting or avoiding dairy products to reduce the risk of prostate cancer; limiting or avoiding alcohol to reduce the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, colon, rectum, and breast; avoiding red and processed meat to reduce the risk of cancers of the colon and rectum; [and] avoiding grilled, fried, and broiled meats to reduce the risk of cancers of the colon, rectum, breast, prostate, kidney, and pancreas.' In this context, the researchers are talking about all meat, including poultry and fish. We don't have to wait, nor should we wait, for scientific consensus. We can and should 'act on the best available evidence' we have right now. The beauty of safe, simple, and side effect\u2013free solutions provided by the lifestyle medicine approach is that they\n\t- ance suggestions on foods to cut down on, where evidence is sufficiently compelling, recommendations included 'limiting or avoiding dairy products to reduce the risk of prostate cancer; limiting or avoiding alcohol to reduce the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx [throat], larynx, esophagus, colon, rectum, and breast; avoiding red and processed meat to reduce the risk of cancers of the colon and rectum; [and] avoiding grilled, fried, and broiled meats to reduce the risk of cancers of the colon, rectum, breast, prostate, kidney, and pancreas.'

Look, we all have to make dietary decisions every day and 'cannot wait for the evolution of scientific consensus.'

Pharmaceutical companies are fighting to be the first to come out with a drug that decreases methionine levels. But since methionine is sourced mainly from food, a better strategy may be to lower methionine levels by lowering methionine intake, eliminating high methionine foods to control cancer growth as well as improve our lifespan (see Methionine Restriction as a Life-Extension Strategy). Here's the thinking: smoking cessation, consumption of diets rich in plants, and other lifestyle measures can prevent the majority of cancers. Unfortunately, people don't do them, and as a result hundreds of thousands of Americans develop metastatic cancer each year. Chemotherapy cures only a few types of metastatic cancer. Unfortunately, the vast majority of common metastatic cancers, such as breast, prostate, colon, and lung, are lethal. We therefore desperately need novel treatment strategies for metastatic cancer, and\n4.

Therefore, a drug scenario, a one in three benefit may not sound particularly appealing. But when we're talking about plant extract proven to be remarkably safe, it would be worth considering even if it just helped 1 in a 100. With no serious downsides, a one in three benefit for end-stage cancer is pretty exciting. To see if colon cancer could be prevented, five years later, researchers at Cleveland Clinic and John Hopkins School of Medicine tested two phytochemicals, curcumin (from turmeric) and quercitin, (found in fruits and vegetables such as red onions and grapes) in people with familial adenomatous polyposis, an inherited form of colon cancer in which individuals develop hundreds of polyps that may become cancerous unless\n5.

So, it may be worth looking deeper into therapies like IV vitamin C. However, the lack of financial reward (since vitamin C can't be patented and sold for $100,000) and bias against alternative medicine 'could dissuade conventional investigators and funding agencies from seriously considering this approach.' So, decades later, what can we conclude? 'After trials which have included at least 1,609 patients over 33 years, we have to conclude that we still do not know whether Vitamin C has any clinically significant antitumor activity.'

As you can see below and at 2:04 in my video, using a hot air vaporizer, like ones from the Volcano brand, results in ammonia levels in the bloodstream more comparable to smoking it.

You can grow human nerve cells in vitro and drip on a little cholesterol, which causes a bump in inflammation. According to a blog on neuropathycure.org, if you add the same amount of oxidized cholesterol, it gets much worse. What's more, if you look at the changes in brain oxysterols at different stages of Alzheimer's disease on autopsy, you can see how the three main cholesterol oxidation products appear to be building up, as I show at 4:48 in my video. Levels have been shown to dramatically increase in Alzheimer's disease brains, adding to the evidence that oxidized cholesterol may be 'the driving force behind the development of Alzheimer's disease.'\n\t- Oxidized cholesterol can be a hundred times more toxic than regular cholesterol, raising additional concerns about foods such as ghee, canned tuna, processed meat, and parmesan cheese. Too much cholesterol in the blood 'has long been considered to act as a primary risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease and, possibly, Parkinson's disease.'

Before even considering putting it to the test, though, one might ask, 'Well, do populations that eat a lot of turmeric have a lower prevalence of dementia?' And indeed, those living in rural India who do just that may actually have the lowest reported prevalence of dementia and Alzheimer's.

Well, if the damage is oxidation, what about eating antioxidant-rich foods, such as the spice turmeric, which contains an antioxidant pigment known as curcumin. I examine this in my video Benefits of Turmeric for Arsenic Exposure. As anyone familiar with my videos can attest, 'numerous clinical studies have suggested that curcumin has therapeutic efficacy against a variety of human diseases,' including cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and inflammatory bowel, joint, lung, skin, and eye diseases.

In the 1990s, though, an alternative explanation arose: The disappointing '80s research only used oral vitamin C, whereas the apparently successful '70s experiments also gave vitamin C intravenously, and we didn't realize until the '90s that the same dose given intravenously can lead to dramatically higher levels in the bloodstream than when taken orally. So maybe high dose vitamin C does help in terminal cancer, but maybe only when given intravenously. This is the topic of discussion in my\n\t- p in terminal cancer, but maybe only when given intravenously. This is the topic of discussion in my video The Role of Vitamin C in the Treatment of Terminal Cancer. Encouraging case reports continued to be published. Regression, remission, and cure had been documented in individual cases of advanced kidney cancer, bladder cancer, and lymphoma, but that was three success stories out of how many? If it was three out of a hundred, or even three out of a thousand, then okay, if the treatment is sufficiently nontoxic. But there is evidence that IV vitamin C is widely used in the alternative medicine world, as in 86 percent of 172 practitioners surveyed. Just those 172 practitioners alone treated about 10,000 patients a year, and manufacturers are selling hundreds of thousands of vials of this stuff in the United States. It's not all being used for cancer, but, presumably, at least thousands of cancer patients are being treated every year with IV vitamin C, making the publication of three\n\t- s of cancer patients are being treated every year with IV vitamin C, making the publication of three remarkable case reports seem less impressive. So no matter how amazing these cases seemed, it's possible the cancers just spontaneously regressed all on their own, and it was just a coincidence that it happened after the patients were given vitamin C. To know for sure, you have to put it to the test. To date, there have been some small pilot studies, and the results so far have been disappointing. The good news is that even insane doses of IV vitamin C seem remarkably safe, but failed in a study of two dozen patients 'to demonstrate anticancer activity.' Similar small studies have been published, all the way through to the present, with results that are tantalizing but inconclusive. What we do know is that the present state of cancer chemotherapy is 'unsatisfactory.' People have a perception that chemotherapy 'will significantly enhance their chances of cure,' but if you put all our\n\t- an be quite a boon for alternative medicine practitioners. About 90 percent of the millions of doses of vitamin C being dispensed are in for-profit arrangements, so there are financial pressures pushing in both directions, for and against this treatment. Given the relative safety and expense, though, if controlled studies even find a small benefit, it would be considered worthwhile. And if they don't, the vitamin C question can be put to rest once and for all. But '[i]n cancer treatment we currently do not have the luxury of jettisoning possibly effective and nontoxic treatments. We should revisit promising avenues, without prejudice and with open minds...' This video is the third installment in a three-part series.

They published their findings in 1976. The researchers didn't have a controlled trial, but, by that point, they had treated a hundred terminal cancer patients with vitamin C. So, they compared their progress to that of a thousand similar patients who did not get vitamin C. For each patient treated with vitamin C, the researchers found ten patients about the same age and with the same kind of cancer who had been treated at the same hospital but who had not received the vitamin C infusions. What did they find? In patients with terminal breast cancer, within a hundred days, more than 80 percent of the women in the control group were dead. (Remember, these were all terminal cancer patients.) However, in the vitamin C group, half were still alive nearly a year later. The vitamin-C group had women with terminal breast cancer still alive 2,270 days later and counting. The control groups for all the different\n\t- atients, the control group patients would die sooner than the treatment group patients, but it would have nothing to do with the treatment; the control group folks may have just started out in a worse place. Indeed, there is evidence that is what happened: A full 20 percent of the control group died within a few days after being declared terminal compared to none in the treatment group, which really does seem fishy. Nevertheless, the trial was successful in finally convincing the National Cancer Institute to fund randomized controlled trials-performed by the prestigious Mayo Clinic, no less. What did they find? Find out in Vitamin C Supplements for Terminal Cancer Patients and The Role of Vitamin C in the Treatment of Terminal Cancer. I have tons of videos on cancer, but here's a sampling:\n\t- In 1975, a remarkable case was reported of a 42-year-old man suffering from a malignant form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who experienced a dramatic regression of the cancer after being given large doses of vitamin C intravenously, as I discuss in my video Intravenous Vitamin C for Terminal Cancer Patients. He seemed cured, so they stopped the vitamin C. The cancer came surging back. They restarted the vitamin C and apparently induced a second complete remission. Sometimes cancer does just spontaneously regress-it's rare, but not unheard of. So, one could argue that the first remission was spontaneous, and it was just a coincidence that it happened when they started the vitamin C. However, given the trajectory the cancer was on, followed by the rapid remission, followed by the relapse when the vitamin C was stopped, followed by a second remission once restarted, the case strongly suggests that the vitamin C had something to do with the cancer's remission. Now, multiple spontaneous\n\t- ggests that the vitamin C had something to do with the cancer's remission. Now, multiple spontaneous regressions do exist. There was a recent case, for example, of a woman with cervical cancer who appeared to be cured with radiation and chemo. Her cancer came back and she refused further treatment. Yet, the tumors disappeared on their own, then came back, then disappeared, then came back, then disappeared, then came back, and then disappeared for a fourth spontaneous remission-and all that was with no apparent treatment at all. So, it's possible this vitamin-C case is just a crazy, coincidental fluke, and the vitamin C didn't help at all. You never know until you put it to the test. Researchers enlisted the help of Linus Pauling, who they considered the greatest chemist of the 20th century and who was known to be interested in vitamin C. If he couldn't get funding, nobody could get funding. And he couldn't get funding. They went to the National Cancer Institute with promising data on\n3.

In Alzheimer's, it's the protein amyloid beta; in Creutzfeldt-Jakob and mad cow disease, it's prions; in Huntington's, it's a different protein; and in Parkinson's disease, it's a protein called alpha synuclein. A variety of pesticides-8 out of the 12 tested by researchers-were able to trigger synuclein accumulation in human nerve cells, at least in a petri dish, though the study has since been retracted so it's unclear what the data actually showed. The buildup of synuclein may play a role in killing off specialized nerve cells in the brain, 70 percent of which may be gone by the time the first symptoms arise. Pesticides are so good at killing these neurons that researchers use them to try to recreate Parkinson's disease in animals. Is there any way to stop the process? As of this writing, there aren't yet any drugs that can prevent this protein aggregation. What about flavonoid phytonutrients, natural compounds found in\n\t- In the original description of Parkinson's disease by none other than Dr. James Parkinson himself, he described a characteristic feature of the disease: constipation, which may precede the diagnosis by many years. In fact, bowel movement frequency may be predictive. Men with less than one bowel movement a day were four times more like likely to develop Parkinson's an average of 12 years later. This could be simply a really early symptom of the disease tied to decreased water intake, however. Many Parkinson's patients report never really feeling very thirsty, and perhaps that led to the constipation. 'Alternately, one may speculate that constipation also increases the risk of Parkinson's disease as constipation results in a longer stay of the feces in the bowel and thus more absorption of neurotoxicants,' neurotoxins from the diet. Two studies suggest an association between constipation and Parkinson's, but, at the same time, 38 studies link the disease to pesticide exposure and by now\n\t- cubate the nerve cells with a blueberry extract, the nerve cell appears better able to withstand the pesticide effects. So, this implies that flavonoids in our diet may be combating Parkinson's disease as we speak, and healthy diets may be effective in preventing and even treating the disorder. However, these were all petri dish experiments in a laboratory. Is there any evidence that people eating berries are protected from Parkinson's? A study published quite a long time ago suggested the consumption of blueberries and strawberries was protective, but it was a tiny study and its results were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, that was the best we had...until now. In a more recent study, those eating a variety of phytonutrients were less likely to develop Parkinson's disease. Specifically, higher intake of berries was associated with significantly lower risk. The accompanying editorial, 'An Apple a Day to Prevent Parkinson Disease,' concluded that more research is necessary,\n2.

Now, we just have to convince the dairy industry to actually do it. Others are not as convinced of the pesticide link. 'Despite clear-cut associations between milk intake and PD [Parkinson's disease] incidence, there is no rational explanation for milk being a risk factor for PD.' If it were the pesticides present in milk that could accumulate in the brain, we would assume that the pesticides would build up in the fat. However, the link between skimmed milk and Parkinson's is just as strong. So, researchers have suggested reverse causation: The milk didn't cause Parkinson's; the Parkinson's caused the milk. Parkinson's makes some people depressed, they reasoned, and depressed people may drink more milk. As such, they suggested we shouldn't limit dairy intake for people with Parkinson's, especially because they are so susceptible to hip fractures. But we now know that milk doesn't appear to\n\t- Parkinson's is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's. Each year in the United States, approximately 60,000 new cases are diagnosed, bringing the total number of current cases up to about a million, with tens of thousands of people dying from the disease every year. The dietary component most often implicated is milk, as I discuss in my video Could Lactose Explain the Milk and Parkinson's Disease Link?, and contamination of milk by neurotoxins has been considered the 'only possible explanation.' High levels of organochlorine pesticide residues have been found in milk, as well as in the most affected areas in the brains of Parkinson's victims on autopsy. Pesticides in milk have been found around the world, so perhaps the dairy industry should require toxin screenings of milk. In fact, inexpensive, sensitive, portable tests are now available with no false positives and no false negatives, providing rapid detection of highly toxic pesticides in milk. Now, we\n3. Title 'Avoiding Dairy to Prevent Parkinson\u2019s' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/want-to-help-prevent-parkinsons-disease-avoid-this/):\n\t- There are four things that may reduce our risk of developing Parkinson's disease: increase exercise, and avoid dairy products, pesticides, and head trauma (please  wear your seatbelt and bike helmet!). What about avoiding pesticides and other industrial pollutants? A recent autopsy study found higher levels in the brains of Parkinson's victims of certain PCBs found in Monsanto's Aroclor, which was banned in 1979. The more PCBs found in the brain, the worse the brain damage. The worst three appeared to be PCBs 138, 153, and 180, all of which are significantly lower in the bodies of those eating plant-based diets. So, does a vegan diet reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease? If you watch my 3-min video Preventing Parkinson's Disease With Diet you'll see that every prospective study looking at dairy products and Parkinson's disease found an increased risk associated with consumption. This may be because dairy products in the United States are contaminated with neurotoxic chemicals.\n4. Title 'Is Milk Lowering Uric Acid a Good Thing or a Bad Thing?' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/is-milk-lowing-uric-acid-a-good-thing-or-a-bad-thing/):\n\t- Parkinson's disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's, is characterized by a slowness of movement, rigidity, tremor, and stooping posture, all of which worsen over time. Non-movement symptoms such as cognitive impairment and sleep, smell, and mood disturbances occur as the disease spreads to other areas of the brain. The cause of Parkinson's is perhaps 'one of the important questions posed by the neurobiology [science] of aging.' For example, why is the consumption of dairy products associated with increased risk of Parkinson's? Perhaps because they contribute to our exposure to pesticides and other neurotoxins like dieldrin, which continues to be found in the autopsied brains of Parkinson's victims. Even though dieldrin was banned decades ago, it lingers in the environment and we 'continue to be exposed to the pesticide through contaminated dairy and meats...' The cause of Parkinson's 'is unlikely to be due to milk compounds such as calcium, vitamin\n5.

This could explain why protective associations have been found for Parkinson's and the consumption of tomatoes, potatoes, and a tomato- and pepper-rich Mediterranean diet. Might nightshade vegetables also help with treating Parkinson's? Well, results from trials of nicotine gum and patches have been patchy. Perhaps nicotine only helps prevent it in the first place, or could it be that it isn't the nicotine at all, but, instead, is some other phytochemical in tobacco and the pepper family? Researchers conclude that their findings will be need to be reproduced to help establish cause and effect before considering dietary interventions to prevent Parkinson's disease, but when the dietary intervention is to eat more delicious, healthy dishes like stuffed peppers with tomato sauce, I don't see the reason we have to wait.

There are all sorts of different scoring systems to rate diet quality. My favorite, for its simplicity, is the dietary phytochemical index-a fancy name for a simple concept. It's just the percentage of your calories from whole plant foods, from 0 to 100. (See Calculate Your Healthy Eating Score.) The average American diet has a score of 12-out of 100. So, on a scale of one to ten, our diet is a one. When people are split up based on how they score, researchers find that the higher the score, the better the metabolic markers when it comes to diabetes risk. As I discuss in my video The Best Diet for Diabetes, there appears to be a stepwise drop in insulin resistance and insulin-producing beta-cell dysfunction as you eat more and more plant-based. Researchers reported the highest group was only scoring about 30 (out of 100). Less than a third of their diet was whole plant foods. Not great, but\n\t- als, a 12-week, randomized clinical trial done in Asia, studied the effect of a strictly plant-based diet centered around brown rice versus the conventional diabetic diet on blood sugar control of patients with type 2 diabetes.

Yet, the participants still lost more weight. Even after controlling for the greater abdominal fat loss in the plant-based group, they still won out. Of course, it only works if you actually do it, but those who pretty much stuck to the healthier diet dropped their A1c levels by 0.9 percent.

Title 'Does Smoking Cannabis Cause Lung Cancer?' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/does-smoking-cannabis-cause-lung-cancer/):\n\t- Can Cannabis Cure Cancer?. Doctor's Note: At least 33 carcinogens are in marijuana smoke, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are also found in grilled meat. Most cigarette users inhale more smoke each day than do marijuana smokers, but cannabis users may inhale more deeply and hold in smoke longer, which can result in depositing four times more tar into their lungs. Using a water bong doesn't seem to reduce the risks of tar buildup. Long-time cannabis users have more lung, oral, and voicebox cancers, but they also tend to be more likely to also smoke tobacco. When cigarette use was accounted for, no increased cancer risk was found and the same was found for head and neck cancer. Regular marijuana use leads to symptoms of chronic bronchitis, but there is no evidence of emphysema (long-term lung damage) or increased risk of lung cancer. Smoking one joint a day for ten years may only translate to six months of smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, and, in most studies on\n\t- s no wonder we can't find a lung cancer link with casual marijuana use. There is also an alternative explanation: Maybe the anti-tumor effects of the cannabis plant counteract the tumor-promoting effects of the carcinogens in the smoke. Anti-tumor effects? Indeed, the original demonstration of an anticancer effect, dating back to 1975, showed that THC can suppress the growth of lung cancer cells in a petri dish, as you can see in the graph and at 3:10 in my video. These kinds of data have led to wild claims of cancer cures on the internet, 'extrapolating the results of preclinical work' (such as in petri dishes and test tubes) 'to humans without any basis in fact.'

The researchers conclude that, 'This finding is highly significant for subjects with asthma, as it indicates that omitting antioxidant-rich foods from the diet, for even a short time frame, will have a detrimental effect on asthma symptoms.' Ironically, the low antioxidant diet consumed by subjects, where they were restricted to one serving of fruit and up to two servings of vegetables per day, is typical of Western diets.

The study found a consistent inverse relationship between prevalence rates of asthma, allergies, and eczema and the intake of plants, starch, grains, and vegetables. Researchers speculated 'over a decade ago that if these findings could be generalized, and if the average daily consumption of these foods increased, an important decrease in symptom prevalence could be achieved.' No need to speculate any more, though, because plants were finally put to the test. Researchers have proposed that 'by eating fewer fruits and vegetables, the susceptibility to potentially harmful inhaled substances of the population as a whole may be increased because of the reduction in antioxidant defenses of the lungs.'

If the antioxidants in the plants are ameliorating asthma, then why can't we take antioxidant pills instead? Because antioxidant pills don't appear to work. Studies using antioxidant supplements on respiratory or allergic diseases have mostly shown no beneficial effects. This discrepancy between data relating to fruit and vegetable intake compared with those using antioxidant supplements may indicate the importance of the whole food, rather than individual components. For example, in the Harvard Nurse's Health Study, women who got the most vitamin E from their diet appeared to be at half the risk for asthma, (which may help explain why nut consumption is associated with significantly lower rates of wheezing), but vitamin E supplements did\n\n",

Here's a summary based on Dr. Greger's blog post titled 'Dr. Oz, Apple Juice, and Arsenic: Chicken May Have 10 Times More' (<https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/dr-oz-apple-juice-and-arsenic-chicken-may-have-10-times-more/>):\n\n- Arsenic is a human carcinogen and is associated with various health issues, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurocognitive deficits in children.\n- Apple juice can contain arsenic due to the use of arsenic-containing pesticides in countries like China. However, chicken may contain even more arsenic.\n- Researchers have estimated that chicken can harbor up to 430 parts per billion (ppb) of arsenic, while apple juice has been found to contain up to 36 ppb.\n- Since Americans consume more chicken than apple juice, chicken may pose a greater arsenic risk. The actual risk can be 15 times higher for chicken compared to apple juice, based on FDA retesting of apple juice samples.\n- Arsenic in chicken comes from arsenic-containing chemicals fed to chickens to control internal parasites and improve their appearance. These feed additives have been banned in Europe for over a decade but are still legal in the US.\n\nIt's important to note that I'm an AI language model, and while I strive to provide accurate information, I can't replace professional medical advice.

We're even seeing arsenic in foods sweetened with organic brown rice syrup. It reminds me of the arsenic in apple juice story. Although the U.S. made lead and arsenic-based pesticides illegal years ago, they still persist in the soil, so even organic products are not immune. There are other sources of arsenic (such as naturally occurring arsenic deposits), but arsenic-containing poultry drugs have been deliberately administered to animals intended for human consumption for 70 years. Consequently, exposures resulting from use of these drugs are far more controllable than are exposures from environmental sources.

(URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/how-much-arsenic-in-rice-came-from-chickens/):\n\t- It may be no coincidence that the rice found most contaminated with arsenic originated from some of the top poultry producing states such as Arkansas, Texas, and Missouri. Earlier this year, researchers at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health found levels of arsenic in chicken feather meal up to 100 times that found in apple juice by Dr. Oz last year and 10 times that just found in rice. Feather meal is made from the billion pounds of feathers plucked from chicken carcasses annually (sometimes with heads, guts, manure, and feet thrown in to increase protein and mineral content) and is fed to farmed fish, pigs, poultry, and cattle as well as used to fertilize both conventional and organic crops. Chicken manure is also used directly as feed and fertilizer and has been found to significantly increase arsenic levels in the soil. Some of the arsenic in apple juice and rice may from the use of arsenic-containing pesticides, but how did arsenic get into the chickens? The poultry industry\n4. Title 'Arsenic in Infant Rice Cereal' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/arsenic-in-infant-rice-cereal/):\n\t- When it comes to rice and rice-based products, pediatric nutrition authorities have recommended that arsenic intake should be as low as possible. 'The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been monitoring the arsenic content in foods' for decades, yet despite the 'well-established science describing the health risks associated with arsenic exposure, no standards have been set limiting the amount of arsenic allowable in foods' in the United States. In 2001, the EPA 'adopted a new stricter standard for arsenic in drinking water,' and in 2013, the FDA proposed a legal limit for apple juice. 'There are still no standards for arsenic in food products despite the fact that food sources are our main source of exposure.' Unlike the United States, China has standards. As of 2014, China set a maximum threshold of inorganic arsenic at 150 parts per billion, stricter than the World Health Organization's limit of 200 ppb. In the United States, a 200 ppb limit wouldn't change the cancer risk\n5. Title 'How Risky Is the Arsenic in Rice?' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/how-risky-is-the-arsenic-in-rice/):\n\t- Getting rice down to the so-called safe water limit for arsenic would still allow for roughly 500 times greater cancer risk than is normally considered acceptable. Given the level of arsenic in rice, how could we figure out how much rice is too much? There are no U.S. standards for arsenic in rice, even though 'food sources are the main source of exposure.' There are limits on arsenic in apple juice and tap water, though. To calculate those, experts must have sat down, determined out how much arsenic a day was too much-too risky-then figured people typically drink about four to eight cups of water a day, and set the limits that way, right? Okay, well, can't we just use their how-much-arsenic-a-day-is-too-much-arsenic-a-day number, and, based on the average arsenic content in rice, figure out how-much-rice-a-day-is-too-much-rice?

Now, statistically, the vegans didn't have a significantly higher risk of any kind of stroke, but that's terrible news for vegans. Do vegans have the same stroke risk as meat eaters? What is elevating their stroke risk so much that it's offsetting all their natural advantages? The same could be said for vegetarians, too. Even though this was the first study of vegetarian stroke incidence, there have been about half a dozen studies on stroke mortality. The various meta-analyses have consistently found significantly lower heart disease risk for vegetarians, but the lower stroke mortality was not statistically significant. Now, there is a new study that can give vegetarians some comfort in the fact that they at least don't have a higher risk of dying from stroke, but that's terrible news for vegetarians. Statistically, vegetarians have the same stroke death rate as meat eaters. Again, what's going on? What is elevating their stroke risk so much that it's\n\t- e some other possibilities, next. So far in this series, we've looked at what to eat and what not to eat for stroke prevention, and whether vegetarians do have a higher stroke risk. It may be worth reiterating that vegetarians do not have a higher risk of dying from a stroke, but they do appear to be at higher risk of having a stroke. How is that possible? Meat is a risk factor for stroke, so how could cutting out meat lead to more strokes? There must be something about eating plant-based that so increases stroke risk that it counterbalances the meat-free benefit. Might it be because plant-based eaters don't eat fish? We turn to omega-3s next. For other videos in this series, see related posts below. There certainly are benefits to vitamin D, though. Here is a sampling of videos where I explore the evidence. The EPIC-Oxford study found that vegetarian diets were associated with lower heart disease risk but a slightly higher risk of stroke compared to meat eaters. This suggests an\n\t- er heart disease risk but a slightly higher risk of stroke compared to meat eaters. This suggests an overall cardiovascular benefit of vegetarian diets, but the reason behind the increased stroke risk remains unclear. Similar to the phenomenon observed with smoking cessation, new vegetarians may appear to have higher rates of heart disease due to the 'sick-quitter effect.' However, when adjusting for this effect, the true benefits of a vegetarian diet in reducing heart disease risk become evident. The increased stroke risk among vegetarians, particularly hemorrhagic strokes, raises questions about the underlying factors contributing to this outcome. Despite having lower heart disease risk, vegetarians do not seem to experience a similar reduction in stroke risk. Vegetarians and vegans tend to have lower vitamin D levels compared to meat eaters, and low vitamin D status is associated with an increased risk of stroke. However, the link between vitamin D and stroke may not be causative,\n2. Title 'The Stroke Risk of Vegetarians\u00a0' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/the-stroke-risk-of-vegetarians/):\n\t- The first study in history on the incidence of stroke in vegetarians and vegans suggests they may be at higher risk. 'When ranked in order of importance, among the interventions available to prevent stroke, the three most important are probably diet, smoking cessation, and blood pressure control.' Most of us these days are doing pretty good about not smoking, but less than half of us exercise enough. And, according to the American Heart Association, only 1 in 1,000 Americans is eating a healthy diet and less than 1 in 10 is even eating a moderately healthy diet, as you can see in the graph below and at 0:41 in my video Do Vegetarians Really Have Higher Stroke Risk?. Why does it matter? It matters because 'diet is an important part of stroke prevention. Reducing sodium intake, avoiding egg yolks, limiting the intake of animal flesh (particularly red meat), and increasing the intake of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lentils....Like the sugar industry, the meat and egg industries\n\t- way. As you can see in the graph below and at 6:16 in my video, stroke is our fifth leading cause of death, whereas heart disease is number one. So, yes, in the study, there were more cases of stroke in vegetarians, but there were fewer cases of heart disease, as you can see below and at 6:29. If there is something increasing stroke risk in vegetarians, it would be nice to know what it is in hopes of figuring out how to get the best of both worlds. This is the question we will turn to next. I called it 21 years ago. There's an old video of me on YouTube where I air my concerns about stroke risk in vegetarians and vegans. (You can tell it's from 2003 by my cutting-edge use of advanced whiteboard technology and the fact that I still had hair.) The good news is that I think there's an easy fix. This is the third in a 12-video series on stroke risk. Links to the others are in the related posts below. Among the interventions available to help prevent strokes, diet, smoking cessation, and\n\t- ke education, socioeconomic class, smoking, exercise, and alcohol. That's what you want. You want to tease out the effects of a vegetarian diet on stroke risk. You want to try to equalize everything else to tease out the effects of just the dietary choice. And, since the meat eaters in the study were an average of ten years older than the vegetarians, you can see how vegetarians could come out worse after adjusting for that. Since stroke risk can increase exponentially with age, you can see how 9 strokes among 1,000 vegetarians in their 40s could be worse than 15 strokes among 1,000 meat-eaters in their 50s. The fact that vegetarians had greater stroke risk despite their lower blood pressure suggests there's something about meat-free diets that so increases stroke risk it's enough to cancel out the blood pressure benefits. But, even if that's true, you would still want to eat that way. As you can see in the graph below and at 6:16 in my video, stroke is our fifth leading cause of\n3.

Unlike the obesity webinar, which was put together mostly just to satisfy the intellectual curiosity of fellow nutrition nerds (more info below!), my February webinar is going to be of a more practical nature. Given that high blood pressure and inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption are among the most important stroke risk factors, you would assume those eating plant-based diets would be at significantly lower risk, just as they are with heart attacks. You might be surprised to learn that there had never been any studies on the incidence of stroke in vegetarians, though...until now. And if you think that is surprising, wait until you hear the results. Yes, they had lower heart disease risk as expected, but those eating meat-free diets appeared to have more stroke risk. If that is indeed the case, what might be the cause, and what can we do about it? I hope you'll join\n5. Title 'What About Omega-3s and Vegetarians\u2019 Stroke Risk?\u00a0' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/what-about-omega-3s-and-vegetarians-stroke-risk/):\n\t- Does eating fish or taking fish oil supplements reduce stroke risk? In my last video, we started to explore what might explain the higher stroke risk in vegetarians found in the EPIC-Oxford study. As you can see below and at 0:25 in my video Vegetarians and Stroke Risk Factors: Omega-3s?, vegetarians have a lower risk of heart disease and cardiovascular disease overall, but a higher risk of stroke. We looked into vitamin D levels as a potential mechanism, but that didn't seem to be the reason. What about long-chain omega-3s, the fish fats like EPA and DHA? Not surprisingly, their levels are found to be 'markedly lower in vegetarians and particularly in vegans than in meat-eaters.' They're about 30 percent lower in vegetarians and more than half as low in vegans, as you can see below and at 0:45 in my video. According to 'the most extensive systematic assessment of effects of omega-3 fats on cardiovascular health to date,' combining 28 randomized controlled trials, there is no benefit\n\n",

Title 'Treating Migraines with Lavender' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/treating-migraines-with-lavender/):\n\t- Lavender has been studied recently for several purposes, including treatment of mood and anxiety disorders (see, for example, the video I profiled in my last post, Lavender for Generalized Anxiety Disorder). Though it's better known for its analgesic (pain-killing) properties, there hasn't been a single documented clinical trial on lavender for the treatment of migraine headaches, which affect tens of millions of Americans every year. That is, until now: 'Lavender Essential Oil in the Treatment of Migraine Headache: A Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.' Migraine sufferers were asked-at the early signs of headache-to rub two to three drops of lavender essential oil onto their upper lip and inhale its vapor for a 15-min period, then score the severity of their headache for the next two hours. In the control group they did the same thing, but with drops of unscented liquid wax instead. Neither group was allowed to use any painkillers. In the lavender group 74 percent of patients had an\n\t-  escape! The lavender researchers concluded that the results of the study suggest that inhalation of lavender essential oil may be an effective and safe treatment modality in acute management of migraine headaches. Migraine sufferers may also want to experiment with avoiding potential triggers such as aspartame (see my video Diet Soda and Preterm Birth). Saffron may also help with headaches (Saffron for the Treatment of PMS) as well may the avoidance of certain parasites (Pork Tapeworms on the Brain and Avoiding Epilepsy Through Diet). A note of caution, though: Pregnant migraine sufferers seeking natural remedies should be wary of advice they may get (Dangerous Advice From Health Food Store Employees). What's better than treating your pain with natural remedies? Not having pain in the first place! Those eating healthy diets are less likely to be on pain medications in general (Say No to Drugs by Saying Yes to More Plants). See, for example:\n\t- either group was allowed to use any painkillers. In the lavender group 74 percent of patients had an improvement in their symptoms-significantly better than placebo. Although lavender wasn't directly compared to more conventional treatments and outcome measures differed, as you can see in the associated video Lavender for Migraine Headaches, lavender appears to stack up pretty well against typical migraine drugs. Lavender helped about three quarters of the time; high dose Tylenol may only work about half the time; and Ibuprofen 57% of the time. The top prescription drug, generic Imitrex, is effective 59% of the time, and the hardcore treatment they use in emergency rooms where they inject you under the skin works 70% of the time. Fortunately all of these work better than the original migraine therapy, known as trepanning, where doctors drilled holes in our head to let the evil spirits escape! The lavender researchers concluded that the results of the study suggest that inhalation of\n\t-  escape! The lavender researchers concluded that the results of the study suggest that inhalation of lavender essential oil may be an effective and safe treatment modality in acute management of migraine headaches. Migraine sufferers may also want to experiment with avoiding potential triggers such as aspartame (see my video Diet Soda and Preterm Birth). Saffron may also help with headaches (Saffron for the Treatment of PMS) as well may the avoidance of certain parasites (Pork Tapeworms on the Brain and Avoiding Epilepsy Through Diet). A note of caution, though: Pregnant migraine sufferers seeking natural remedies should be wary of advice they may get (Dangerous Advice From Health Food Store Employees). What's better than treating your pain with natural remedies? Not having pain in the first place! Those eating healthy diets are less likely to be on pain medications in general (Say No to Drugs by Saying Yes to More Plants). See, for example:\n2.

So orange aromatherapy may potentially reduce anxiety without the downer effect of Valium-type drugs. Does that mean we can get the benefits without the side effects? I've talked about the concerns of using scented consumer products before, even ones based on natural fragrances (Throw Household Products Off the Scent), and there have been reports of adverse effects of aromatherapy. Alternative medicine isn't necessarily risk-free. For example, there are dozens of reported cases of people having their hearts ruptured by acupuncture. Ouch. But the adverse effects of aromatherapy were mostly from skin irritation from essential oils being applied topically, or even worse swallowed. Certain citrus oils can also make your skin sensitive to sunlight. Lavender may also help for both anxiety (Lavender for Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and migraines (Lavender for Migraine Headaches). The only other aromatherapy-related video is Wake Up and Smell\n\t- es (Lavender for Migraine Headaches). The only other aromatherapy-related video is Wake Up and Smell the Saffron, though I have others on natural ways do reduce anxiety, including: Natural, though, doesn't always mean safe.

Unfortunately, these substances can not only make one feel hungover, but they have a high potential for drug abuse and addiction. So researchers decided to give lavender a try. Ativan certainly reduced anxiety, but so did the lavender. By the end of the study you couldn't tell which group was which, and among those that responded to either, the lavender actually seemed to work better. The spice saffron may be aromatherapeutic as well. See Wake Up and Smell the Saffron for its role in treating PMS, above and beyond its other effects on the brain (Saffron vs. Prozac, Saffron for the Treatment of Alzheimer's, and Saffron Versus Aricept). Since lavender oil has no potential for drug abuse and no sedating side-effects, it appeared to be an effective and well-tolerated alternative to benzodiazepine drugs for amelioration of generalized anxiety. One cautionary note,\n\t- t Dairy & Sexual Precocity. More on lavender in Lavender for Migraine Headaches. And more on dietary interventions for anxiety can be found in: For more flower power see my blog and videos on hibiscus tea (Better Than Green Tea) and chamomile tea (Chamomile Tea May Not Be Safe During Pregnancy).

Title 'Headache and Migraine Relief from Foods\u00a0' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/headache-and-migraine-relief-from-foods/):\n\t- Plant-based diets are put to the test for treating migraine headaches. Headaches are one of the top five reasons people end up in emergency rooms and one of the leading reasons people see their doctors in general. One way to try to prevent them is to identify their triggers and avoid them. Common triggers for migraines include stress, smoking, hunger, sleep issues, certain foods (like chocolate, cheese, and alcohol), your menstrual cycle, or certain weather patterns (like high humidity). In terms of dietary treatments, the so-called Father of Modern Medicine, William Osler suggested trying a 'strict vegetable diet.' After all, the nerve inflammation associated with migraines 'may be reduced by a vegan diet as many plant foods are high in anti-inflammatory compounds and antioxidants, and likewise, meat products have been reported to have inflammatory properties.' It wasn't put to the test, though, for another 117 years. As I discuss in my video Friday Favorites: Foods That Help\n\t- to get in three cups of tea, as you can see below, and at 4:00 in my video. (I believe it is just a coincidence that the principal investigator of this study was named Lipton.) Please note that you can overdo it. If you take kids and teens with headaches who were drinking 1.5 liters of cola a day and cut the soda, you can cure 90 percent of them. However, this may be a cola effect rather than a caffeine effect. And, finally, one plant food that may not be the best idea is the Carolina Reaper, the hottest chili pepper in the world. It's so mind-numbingly hot it can clamp off the arteries in your brain, as seen below and at 4:41 in my video, and you can end up with a 'thunderclap headache,' like the 34-year-old man who ate the world's hottest pepper and ended up in the emergency room. Why am I not surprised it was a man? I've previously covered ginger and topical lavender for migraines. Saffron may help relieve PMS symptoms, including headaches.

And you may be interested in Benefits of Turmeric for Arsenic Exposure.\n\t- Arsenic is not just considered to be a carcinogen; it's also designated as a 'nonthreshold carcinogen, meaning that any dose, no matter how small, carries some cancer risk'-so there really isn't a 'safe' level of exposure. Given that, it may be reasonable to 'use the conservative ALARA' approach, reducing exposure As Low As Reasonably Achievable. Junk foods made out of brown rice syrup, rice milk, and white rice are not just processed foods, but also arsenic-contaminated processed foods, so they may belong in the red zone as red-light foods we should avoid. What about something like whole brown rice? That is more difficult, because there are pros to help outweigh the cons. I discuss this in my video Is White Rice a Yellow-Light or Red-Light Food?, where you can see a graphical depiction of my traffic light food system at 0:49. The rice industry argues that the 'many health benefits of rice consumption outweigh any potential risk,' which is the same sentiment you hear coming out of\n\t- some in vitro data. For example, in a petri dish, as you can see at 4:05 in my video, there are rice phytonutrients that, at greater and greater doses, can inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells while apparently leaving normal colon cells alone, which is exciting. And, indeed, those who happened to eat those phytonutrients in the form of brown rice once or more a week between colonoscopies had a 40 percent lower risk of developing polyps. (The consumption of green leafy vegetables, dried fruit, and beans were also associated with lower polyp incidence.) But, the only reason we care about the development of polyps is that polyps can turn into cancer. But, there had never been studies on brown rice consumption and cancer...until now, which I discuss in my video Do the Pros of Brown Rice Outweigh the Cons of Arsenic?. For those unfamiliar with my traffic light system, I talk about it in my book trailer. Check out How Not to Die: An Animated Summary. Almost there! This is the\n2.

Brown rice averages two-thirds more toxic arsenic than white rice. But, is that just because brown rice tends to be a different strain or grown in different places? No. If you take the exact same batch of brown rice and measure the arsenic levels before and after polishing it to white, you do get a significant drop in arsenic content. It's not what you eat, though. It's what you absorb. The arsenic in brown rice appears to be less bioavailable than the arsenic in white rice. The texture of brown rice may cut down on the release of arsenic from the grain, or perhaps the bran in brown rice helps bind it up. Regardless, taking bioavailability into account, the difference in arsenic levels in white versus brown rice may be a third more, rather than 70 percent more, as you can see at 2:57 in my video. This estimate, however, was based on an in vitro gastrointestinal fluid system in which researchers strung together beakers and tubes to mimic\n\t- grain rice, but this may be because most of the shorter grains are produced in California, which has significantly less contaminated rice paddies than those in the South, such as in Texas or Arkansas, where most of the long grain rice is grown. So, it's less long grain versus short grain than white rice versus brown rice, as the mean concentration of inorganic arsenic in parts per billion of long grain white rice is 102.0 and 156.5 in short, medium, and long grain brown rice, as you can see at 0:54 in my video. What about some of the naturally pigmented varieties like red rice or black rice, which may be even healthier than brown? As you can see at 1:08 in my video, they may contain even less arsenic than white rice. One sample of black rice from China that was purchased in Kuwait had higher levels for total arsenic, so the toxic inorganic portion may only be half that, putting it on par with U.S. brown rice. The study's red rice sample from Sri Lanka was even more extraordinary, with\n4. Title 'Is There Arsenic in Rice? How Much Rice Is Too Much?'

However, as we discussed, boiling rice like pasta and then draining off the excess water does really cut way down on the arsenic, and, while that cooking method also takes a whack at the nutrition in white rice, the nutrient loss in brown rice is 'significantly less,' as it is not so much enriched as it is rich in nutrition in the first place. 'Cooking brown rice in large amounts of excess water reduces the toxic arsenic by almost 60% and only reduces the iron content by 5%. It reduces the vitamin content of brown rice by about half,' however. You can see a graph of what I'm talking about at 3:18 in my video. A quick rinse of brown rice before you cook it doesn't lower arsenic levels, but boiling it and draining off the excess water, instead of cooking to dry, drops arsenic levels by 40 percent. That was using about a ratio of 6 parts water to 1 part rice. What if you use even more water, boiling at 10-to-1 water-to-rice ratio? You get a 60 percent drop in\n\n",

Even if we were able to just delay the onset by as little as 1 year, we could potentially prevent more than 9 million cases over the next 40 years. Once cognitive functions are lost in Alzheimer's disease patients, they may be lost forever. Consequently, prevention, rather than a cure for Alzheimer's disease appears to be a more realistic strategy to offset the catastrophic impact of this dementia. As I discuss in my video Cholesterol & Alzheimer's Disease '[c]onsiderable evidence now indicates that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is primarily a vascular disorder,' based on a number of lines of evidence that point toward impaired circulation of blood to the brain. Vascular risk factors, such as high cholesterol, can be\n\t- with cholesterol-lowering statin drugs. This is ironic, since statins themselves can cause cognitive impairment. Though rare, statin side effects may 'include short- and long-term memory loss, behavioral changes, impaired concentration and attention, paranoia, and anxiety,' as early as five days after starting the drugs, but sometimes even months later, though folks should recover within a month of stopping the drugs. A better strategy may be to change the lifestyle factors that lead to the high cholesterol in the first place-in particular, reducing saturated fat in the diet. It's not enough for us to just tell our individual patients, though. 'Systematic implementation of educational campaigns promoting radical changes in cultural and societal values' may be necessary to adopt Alzheimer's-defeating strategies by patients in a broader sense, and 'such actions may provide potentially huge dividends by preventing both cardiovascular disease and dementia'-two of our leading causes of\n3.

Indeed, Nigerians have high ApoE4, but Alzheimer's is a rarity, thanks, perhaps, to low cholesterol levels, which any of us can achieve by eating healthfully. These findings suggest that 'long-term changes in plasma cholesterol...can lead to changes in brain ApoE expression.' Just because we may have been dealt some bad genetic cards doesn't mean we can't reshuffle the deck with diet. We cannot change our genetic makeup, but we can 'reduce or prevent high cholesterol.' In a study of a thousand people for more than 20 years, ApoE4 doubled the odds of Alzheimer's, but high cholesterol nearly tripled the threat. So, the 'risk for Alzheimer disease from treatable factors-elevated total cholesterol level and blood pressure-appears to be greater' than that from the dreaded Alzheimer's susceptibility gene. In fact, projecting from their data, controlling lifestyle factors could reduce a person's risk for Alzheimer's disease from nine or ten times the odds down to just\n\t- rs could reduce a person's risk for Alzheimer's disease from nine or ten times the odds down to just two-even if they have the double barrel ApoE4 gene from both parents. 'People tend to have a fatalistic view toward developing Alzheimer disease,' as though it's going to happen if it's going to happen, but such a view has been undermined. We just need to emphasize the need for preventing and treating high blood pressure and cholesterol in the first place to reduce our risks for heart disease, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease, and, 'as a result, potentially enhance quantity and quality of life....Of equal importance, these data should be comforting to anyone interested in attempting to reduce the risk for and future burden of Alzheimer disease.' So what are these dietary changes that help lower our risk? See some of my latest videos on preventing Alzheimer's disease: If you'd like to learn more about the exciting world of epigenetics and this concept of switching genes on and off, see\n4. Title 'Preventing Alzheimer\u2019s Disease with Diet' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/preventing-alzheimers-disease-diet/):\n\t- Up to half of Alzheimer's cases may be attributable to just seven risk factors shown in my video, Preventing Alzheimer's with Lifestyle Changes, which include diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, exercise, smoking, depression, and mental exercise; and that's not including diet because there are so many dietary factors that researchers couldn't fit them into their model. But, they acknowledged that diet might be another important modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. In particular, there is growing evidence that dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, are associated with lower Alzheimer's risk, as well as slower cognitive decline, but which constituents of the Mediterranean diet are responsible? The traditional Mediterranean diet is a diet high in intake of vegetables, beans, fruit, and nuts, and low in meat and dairy. When researchers tried to tease out the protective components, fish consumption showed no benefit, neither did moderate alcohol consumption. The\n5.

In light of such findings, some have even suggested the disease be reclassified as vascular disorder. This is good news, though, because atherosclerosis is potentially reversible. These findings were confirmed in two larger studies of more than 1,000 autopsies each, which found the same thing. Atherosclerosis in the brain is significantly more frequent and severe in those with Alzheimer's disease. This suggests that strategies proven to delay the progression of artery disease like plant-based diets may be useful for preventing or treating Alzheimer's disease. Of course, autopsy studies are a little late for that, so to assess the impact of intracranial arterial narrowing on the progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, researchers followed 400 people with cognitive impairment for four years using CT\n\n",

In terms of reduction of pain, as you can see below and at 2:32 in my video, the best results were achieved with one and a half or two grams a day, which is a full teaspoon of ground ginger. The drugs work by suppressing an enzyme in the body called cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which triggers inflammation. The problem is that they also suppress cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), which does good things like protect the lining of your stomach and intestines. 'Since inhibition of COX-1 is associated with gastrointestinal irritation, selective inhibition of COX-2'-the inflammatory enzyme-'should help minimize this side effect' and offer the best of both worlds.

Best results have been achieved with 1.5 to 2.0 g a day (about a teaspoon of ground ginger). NSAIDs suppress both the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, which triggers inflammation, as well as cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), which protects stomach and intestinal linings; inhibition of COX-1 has been linked with GI irritation. Ginger appears to have no negative effect on the 'good' COX-1 enzyme but may dramatically reduce the pro-inflammatory COX-2 enzyme. Although ginger may not acutely improve muscle pain, taking a teaspoon or two for consecutive days or weeks may reduce muscle pain and soreness, as well as hasten recovery of muscular strength. Shogaols may be the most potent anti-inflammatory component in ginger, and dried ginger contains more than fresh, so powdered ginger may be preferred to fresh. Shogaols are created when ginger is dried, but heating ginger doesn't\n3.

If you just couldn't live without rice milk for some reason, you could make your own using lower arsenic rice, like brown basmati from India, Pakistan, or California, but then your homemade rice milk might have even less nutrition, as most of the commercial brands are at least fortified. Better options might be soy, oat, hemp, or almond milk, though you don't want kids to be drinking too much almond milk. There have been a few case reports of little kids drinking four cups a day and running into kidney stone problems due to its relatively high oxalate content, which averages about five times more than soy milk.

So, it's less long grain versus short grain than white rice versus brown rice, as the mean concentration of inorganic arsenic in parts per billion of long grain white rice is 102.0 and 156.5 in short, medium, and long grain brown rice, as you can see at 0:54 in my video. What about some of the naturally pigmented varieties like red rice or black rice, which may be even healthier than brown? As you can see at 1:08 in my video, they may contain even less arsenic than white rice. One sample of black rice from China that was purchased in Kuwait had higher levels for total arsenic, so the toxic inorganic portion may only be half that, putting it on par with U.S. brown rice. The study's red rice sample from Sri Lanka was even more extraordinary, with\n\t- Brown rice contains more arsenic than white rice, but the arsenic in brown rice is less absorbable, so how does it wash out when you compare the urine arsenic levels of white-rice eaters to brown-rice eaters? Arsenic in rice is a cause for concern, according to a consensus statement by the European and North American societies for pediatric nutrition. At the very least, 'in areas of the world where rice consumption is high in all ages, authorities should be prompted to declare which of the rice [types] have the lowest arsenic content and are, therefore, the least harmful for use during infancy and childhood.' I look into the arsenic content of different rices in my video Which Rice Has Less Arsenic: Black, Brown, Red, White, or Wild?. Extensive recent testing by the FDA found that long grain white rice, which is what most people eat, appears to have more arsenic than medium or short grain rice, but this may be because most of the shorter grains are produced in California, which has\n4.

How is that a reasonable suggestion? Another wonky, thinking-outside-the-rice-box idea involves an algae discovered in the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park that has an enzyme that can volatize arsenic into a gas. Researchers genetically engineered that gene into a rice plant and were able to get a little arsenic gas off of it, but the rice industry is hesitant.

Indeed, just a daily half-teaspoon of mild seaweeds, like arame or dulse, or two sheets of nori should net you all the iodine you need for the day. But, the intake of seaweeds is advised not only as a whole-food source of iodine, but also, evidently, 'for the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease....' Based on what? As I discuss in my video Wakame Seaweed Salad May Lower Blood Pressure, the reasoning is that the Japanese live long and eat seaweed, so there is speculation that seaweed might have 'influence on life expectancy,' based on suggestive reports. But when we see long lists of the supposed benefits a particular food is purported to have, such as 'compounds found in [seaweed] have various biological activities including anticoagulant, anti-viral, antioxidant,\n3.

And a study of seaweed eaters in California actually found decreased risk, but, again, we're talking a modest level of intake. I've frequently talked about the benefits of dietary diversity, eating different families of fruits and vegetables, eating different parts of individual plants-such as beets and beet greens.

Animal protein intake profoundly affects normal human kidney function, inducing what's called hyperfiltration, which increases the workload of the kidney. This may help explain why our kidneys fail so often. 'Unlimited intake of protein-rich foods, now generally regarded as 'normal,' may be responsible for dramatic differences in renal function between modern human beings and their remote predecessors who hunted and scavenged for meat.' Indeed, our kidney reserves are continuously called upon by our sustained, rather than intermittent, excesses of protein.

We know this because administration of a powerful anti-inflammatory drug abolished the hyperfiltration,  protein leakage response to meat ingestion. Kidney stress has been shown to escalate in response to a meat meal, but that stress level remains low during the meal when supplemented with an anti-inflammatory drug.

Also known as 'the meat-sweet diet or standard American diet,' it causes an impairment of kidney blood flow, inflammation, subsequent leakage of protein in the urine, and a rapid decrease in kidney function. Table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are associated with increased blood pressure and uric acid levels, both of which can damage the kidney. The saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol found in animal fat and junk food negatively impact kidney function, as well. The consumption of animal fat can actually alter the structure of the kidney, and animal protein can deliver an acid load to the kidneys, increase ammonia production, and damage the sensitive kidney cells. This is why restricting protein intake is recommended for preventing kidney function decline-though it may be animal protein in particular that may need restricting, not just protein in general. So,\n\t- h it may be animal protein in particular that may need restricting, not just protein in general. So, the source of the protein, plant versus animal, may be more important than the amount regarding adverse health consequences. Animal protein intake profoundly affects normal human kidney function, inducing what's called hyperfiltration, which increases the workload of the kidney. This may help explain why our kidneys fail so often. 'Unlimited intake of protein-rich foods, now generally regarded as 'normal,' may be responsible for dramatic differences in renal function between modern human beings and their remote predecessors who hunted and scavenged for meat.' Indeed, our kidney reserves are continuously called upon by our sustained, rather than intermittent, excesses of protein. This causes a kind of unrelenting stress on our kidneys that can predispose even healthy people to progressive kidney scarring and deterioration of kidney function. It's as if we're always revving our engine\n2. Title 'How Not to Die from Kidney Disease' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/how-not-to-die-from-kidney-disease/):\n\t- Kidney failure may be both prevented and treated with a plant-based diet, and it's no wonder: Kidneys are highly vascular organs, packed with blood vessels. Harvard researchers found three significant dietary risk factors for declining kidney function: 'animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol.' Animal fat can alter the actual structure of our kidneys. In my video How Not to Die from Kidney Disease, you can see plugs of fat literally clogging up the works in autopsied human kidneys from a study published in The American Journal of Pathology. Animal protein can have a 'profound effect' on normal kidney function, inducing 'hyperfiltration,' increasing the workload of the kidney. Not plant protein, though. After eating a meal of tuna fish, the increased pressure on the kidneys goes up within only a few hours. We aren't talking about adverse effects decades down the road, but literally within hours of it going into our mouths. What happens if, instead of having a tuna salad sandwich,\n\t- within hours of it going into our mouths. What happens if, instead of having a tuna salad sandwich, you had a tofu salad sandwich with the exact same amount of protein? No effect on your kidneys. Our kidneys have no problem dealing with plant protein is no problem. Why does animal protein cause the overload reaction, but plant protein doesn't? It appears to be due to the inflammation triggered by the consumption of animal products. Indeed, taking a powerful, anti-inflammatory drug along with that tuna fish sandwich can abolish the hyperfiltration, protein-leakage response to meat ingestion. There's also the acid load. Animal foods, such as meat, eggs, and dairy, induce the formation of acid within the kidneys, which may lead to 'tubular toxicity,' damage to the tiny, delicate, urine-making tubes in the kidney. Animal foods tend to be acid-forming-especially fish, which is the worst, followed by pork and poultry-whereas plant foods tend to be relatively neutral, or actually alkaline\n3. Title 'Key Takeaways on Protein and a Protein-Rich Recipe' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/key-takeaways-on-protein-and-a-protein-rich-recipe/):\n\t- Not all protein is created equal. Animal proteins have different impacts on our kidneys, for example, than proteins from plants. Within hours of consuming meat, our kidneys rev up into hyperfiltration mode, dramatically increasing their workload. This is true of a variety of animal proteins.

Cholesterol can then help seed the clumping of the amyloid. Using an electron microscope, researchers can see the clustering of amyloid fibers on and around little microcrystals of cholesterol. Once in the brain, cholesterol can also undergo auto-oxidation, causing the formation of highly toxic free radicals. So, having high cholesterol levels in the blood is thought to increase the risk of dementia, not only by inducing atherosclerosis and impairing blood flow, but also by potentially directly affecting neurodegeneration within the brain. In conclusion, excess dietary cholesterol could, in principle, contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease, and the evidence linking high cholesterol to Alzheimer's appears to be steadily mounting. Some of this work was paid for by drug companies hoping to capitalize on Alzheimer's with cholesterol-lowering statin drugs. This is ironic, since statins themselves can cause cognitive\n\t- blood, but also the influx of cholesterol into the central nervous system. In addition, having high cholesterol may even damage the blood-brain barrier itself, and allow for even more cholesterol to flow into the brain, providing the missing link between high cholesterol and Alzheimer's. 'Individuals with higher cholesterol levels at midlife have a higher risk of developing [Alzheimer's disease].' Cholesterol over 250 could potentially triple the odds of Alzheimer's. We now have high-tech PET scanning of the brain that can directly correlate the amount of bad LDL cholesterol in our blood with the amount of amyloid buildup in our brains. You can even do it right in a petri dish. Adding cholesterol makes brain cells churn out more of the amyloid that makes up Alzheimer plaques, whereas removing cholesterol can decrease the levels of amyloid released from cells. Amyloid degradation is also less efficient in a high cholesterol environment. Cholesterol can then help seed the clumping of\n\t- impaired circulation of blood to the brain. Vascular risk factors, such as high cholesterol, can be thought of as a ticking time bomb to Alzheimer's disease. What's bad for the heart may be bad for the mind. Traditionally, there have been two competing theories for the cause of Alzheimer's: the amyloid cascade model, which implicates the buildup of amyloid plaques within the brain, and the vascular model, which argues that it is the lack of adequate blood flow to the brain due to atherosclerosis. We now realize they are not mutually exclusive and that arterial disease can set up a vicious cycle in which atherosclerotic plaques in the arteries may contribute to Alzheimer's plaques in the brain. Although cholesterol has been portrayed as 'tantamount to poison,' it is an essential structural component of all of our cells, and that's why our body makes it. But, if there's too much, it can become a major factor contributing to various diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke,\n3.

So, in terms of reducing cholesterol oxidation in foods, the primary method may be to 'reduce the total cholesterol content of the food'-that is, don't just avoid adding extra butter; instead, center one's diet around whole plant foods, which don't have any cholesterol to get oxidized in the first place. One of the main triggers of Alzheimer's disease? Indeed. Check out my video Oxidized Cholesterol as a Cause of Alzheimer's Disease.

Why? In the 1980s, a team of respected Norwegian researchers reported a peculiar finding. They were comparing the urine of children with and without autism in the hopes of teasing out any differences that could lead to hints to the cause of autism. As you can see at 0:42 in my video Autism and Casein from Cow's Milk, a urine profile shows spikes for each of the various components. Normally, the urine's peptides region is pretty quiet.

Until there's more solid evidence of benefit, I'd stick with just drinking the tea. Green or black? A recent study that randomized about a hundred men with prostate cancer to consume six cups a day of green tea or black tea found a significant drop in PSA levels and NF-kB in the green tea group, but not in either the black tea or control groups, as you can see at 4:12 in my video. NF-kB is thought to be a prognostic marker for prostate cancer progression, so the green tea did appear to work better than the black tea.

Population studies linking green tea consumption with lower cancer risk have led some to advocate for the incorporation of green tea into the diet 'so as to fully benefit from its anticarcinogenic properties.' What, after all, is the downside? But, population studies can't prove cause and effect. Indeed, 'it is not possible to determine from these population-based studies whether green tea actually prevents cancer in people'...until it is put to the test. Prostate cancer is preceded by a precancerous condition known as intraepithelial neoplasia. You can see a graphic of the progression at 0:41 in my video Treating Prostate Cancer with Green Tea. Within one year, about 30 percent of such lesions turn into cancer. Because no treatment is given to patients until cancer is diagnosed, this presents a perfect opportunity to try green tea. In the study, 60 men with precancerous prostate intraepithelial neoplasia were randomized into\n3. Title 'Does Green Tea Help Prevent Prostate Cancer?'

In Japan, however, the 'high' tea-drinking group can consume five or more cups a day, which was associated with about halving the risk of aggressive prostate cancer. How? Apparently, it was not by preventing the formation of the cancer in the first place, but perhaps by slowing or stopping the cancer's growth. If green tea can stop the growth of prostate cancer, why not try giving green tea to prostate cancer patients to see if it will help? Green tea is actually put to the test in cancer patients in my video Treating Prostate Cancer with Green Tea. Interested in more on tea? See:\n4.

'Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that there is no safe level of Pb [lead] intake,' and, ideally, we should get contaminant levels down to zero. As a consumer group pointed out, a quarter of the lipsticks were lead-free, so we know it can be done. Maybe we should better regulate toxic metals in cosmetics to protect women's health in the United States, as has already been done in Europe. Fair enough, but it wasn't well-received. The billion-dollar lipstick industry wasn't happy. In an article that tried to downplay the risks, the scientists-for-hire firm that once played villain in the real-life Erin Brockovich case concluded that, even though lipstick may contain lead, the concentrations are so low that they 'are not expected to pose any health risks to adults or children.'

Hold on. The highest concentration found was 10,185 mg/kg. That's 10 grams per kilogram, which means the lipstick was 1 percent pure lead. That means a single application could expose a grown woman to perhaps 12 times the tolerable daily intake.

Certified organic meat comes from animals 'fed with organically produced feed that is free of pesticides and animal by-products,' by law. Therefore, one would assume 'there should be lower accumulation of chemical residues. However, practically, there are no studies on the chemical residues' content in organic meat'-that is, there weren't any...until now. Researchers acquired 76 samples of different kinds of meat, both organic and conventional, and quantified their levels of contamination with 33 different carcinogenic persistent organic pollutants. After all, 'the ingestion of food contributes more than 90% to the total current exposure to these compounds, especially those food of animal origin such as fish, dairy products, or meat.'

Coconut water was found to help in cases of mild dehydration due to childhood diarrhea, 'despite not having a balanced electrolyte composition,' meaning its sodium-to-potassium ratio was off. Coconut water contains so much potassium that people with kidney disease who drink two quarts of it but don't have normal kidney function that would otherwise flush away the excess can run into 'life-threatening hyperkalemia,' too much potassium in the blood. People may not realize how much potassium coconut water has, so even if your doctor advised you to stay away from high potassium foods, you may drink coconut water, not realizing its high potassium content, and run into problems.

What does that actually mean, though? Well, it's evidence that the human brain has at least some sensitivity to the effects of cell phone radiation. The increased metabolism in brain regions closest to the antenna 'suggest that brain absorption of [cell phone emissions] may enhance the excitability of brain tissue.' The potential health consequences of this are unknown, though the results suggest that 'cell phone use can possibly affect brain function,' potentially affecting neurotransmitter and neurochemical brain activities. Perhaps this can explain the changes in psychological test outcomes observed after exposure to cell phone radiation. Although earlier studies failed to find an effect of short-term\n\t- er exposure to cell phone radiation. Although earlier studies failed to find an effect of short-term cell exposure on human cognitive performance, a 2017 review noted that 'several studies indicate an increase in cortical excitability and/or efficiency with EMF exposure,' which may translate out into measurable cognitive effects. What's more, this 'cortical excitability'-excitability of the outer layer of the brain tied to cell phone exposure-'might also underpin disruptions in sleep' while at the same time being 'associated with faster reaction time.' If you expose people to active cell phones while they play a computer game, the subjects can actually respond faster compared to sham exposure, meaning placebo exposure of the same scenario but with the cell phone turned off. This empowered the industry to claim that while it may be the case that cell phone radiation does affect brain function after all, the effects are positive!

(URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/is-our-sleep-affected-by-smartphones/):\n\t- What are the effects of cell phone radiation on sleep quantity and quality? 'Sleep is crucial to the development of physically and psychologically healthy children,' but a number of factors have been identified as interfering with sufficient sleep, including the use of electronic media devices. These days, most children and nearly all adolescents have at least one such device 'in their sleep environment, with most used near bedtime.' Such use is associated with 'inadequate sleep quantity, poor sleep quality, with excessive daytime sleepiness.' There are calls to minimize access to these devices at bedtime, but 'which comes first, media use or sleep problem?' Are the kids and teens not sleeping because they're on their phone, or are they on their phone because they can't sleep? I discuss this in my video Friday Favorites: Do Mobile Phones Affect Sleep?. 'Higher media use has been consistently associated with more irregular sleep patterns, shorter sleep duration, as well as more sleep\n4. Title 'Salivary Gland Tumors from Cell Phone Use?'

If you want to reduce your risk, though, both the heat and emissions from cell phones are largely local phenomena, so you can use a speakerphone or headset to reduce exposure. You can also text more and talk less. Until we know more, 'the adoption of such precautions, particularly among young people, is advisable.' In fact, there is enough concern that a researcher recommends young children to consider minimizing their use of cell phones altogether. Cell phone radiation does not seem to have any acute effects, such as nausea, headaches, dizziness, or fatigue, but there may be potential long-term effects. The parotid gland is the large salivary gland right next to our eat, and about one in a thousand people develop salivary gland cancer in their lifetime. In an observational study, researchers found that talking for more than an hour on a cell phone decreases the antioxidant capacity of our saliva, compared with talking less than 20 minutes.

The analysis found no influence on mortality either way. Some found more cancer mortality, some found less cancer mortality, but all in all it was a wash. And that was heralded as good news. After the Iowa Women's Health Study came out we were worried multivitamins could be harming millions of people, but instead they don't appear to have much effect either way. The accompanying editorial asked whether meta-analyses trump observational studies. The Iowa Women's Health Study followed tens of thousands of women for nearly 20 years. What if we put all the studies together, the big observational studies along with the experimental trials? And that's what we got in December 2013. The review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, highlighted in my video, Should We Take a Multivitamin? found that multivitamins appear to offer no consistent evidence of benefit for heart\n2.

So, for veggie washes to brag they are three, four, five, ten times better than water is indeed mathematically questionable. Other fruit and vegetable washes have since been put to the test. Researchers compared FIT Fruit & Vegetable Wash, Organiclean, Vegi-Clean, and dishwashing soap to just rinsing in plain tap water. 196 samples of lettuce, strawberries, and tomatoes were tested, and researchers found little or no difference between just rinsing with tap water compared to any of the veggie washes (or the dish soap).

Though, no, it does not seem to reduce the adverse impacts of earthquakes. The only concern is that it may give people license to order an extra doughnut or something.

In fact, a significant increase in blood cholesterol was found within hours of eating a slice of cake made from either coconut oil (or cod liver oil for that matter), but not from the same cake made from flaxseed oil. As you can see at 1:10 in my video, coconut oil may even be worse than tallow, or beef fat, but it is not as bad as butter. An interventional trial was published in March 2017: a month-long randomized, controlled, crossover study looking at the impact of two tablespoons per day of virgin coconut oil. The result? Coconut oil elevated cholesterol about 14 percent over the control, which was consistent with seven other interventional trials published to date in a 2016 review. Hold on.

The 'lack of benefit of raising the HDL cholesterol level with the use of niacin...seriously undermine[s] the hypothesis that HDL cholesterol is a causal risk factor.' In simple terms: 'High HDL may not protect the heart.' We should concentrate on lowering LDL. So, specifically, as this relates to coconut oil, the increase in HDL 'is of uncertain clinical relevance,' but the increase in LDL you get from eating coconut oil 'would be expected to have an adverse effect' on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

Alcohol, for example, is strongly associated with breast cancer risk, but the data has been mixed as to whether once you already have a full-blown tumor, it makes a difference if you continue to drink or not. Still, in general, the diet that helps prevent breast cancer is the same diet that's going to help prolong survival.

Given the composite nature of the intervention-both a lower fat diet and addition of flax seeds, it was unknown whether the effects could be attributed to flax seed supplementation, a fat-restricted diet, or both factors working together.

Scientists believe this is due to a class of phytonutrients known as lignans, which are present in flaxseeds at levels up to 800 times other plant foods. Lignans can be thought of as the Western equivalent of the isoflavone phytoestrogens found in soy foods popular in traditional Asian diets, as they share many purported anti-cancer mechanisms. Since soy food consumption is associated with both preventing breast cancer and prolonging breast cancer survival, one might expect the same to be found for lignans.

        "txt_response": "Sure, I can provide some information regarding paper-filtered coffee and its effect on cholesterol. According to the blog post 'Paper-Filtered Coffee and Cholesterol' (<https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/paper-filtered-coffee-and-cholesterol/>), paper-filtered coffee typically does not raise cholesterol levels. This is because the cholesterol-raising compound, called cafestol, gets stuck in the paper filter during the brewing process. However, recent studies mentioned in the post 'Does Coffee Affect Cholesterol?' (<https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/does-coffee-affect-cholesterol/>) suggest that even paper-filtered coffee may slightly raise 'bad' LDL cholesterol.\n\nIt's important to note that individual responses to coffee might vary. If you have high cholesterol and are concerned about the potential effects of coffee, you may consider reducing or eliminating your coffee intake and monitoring your cholesterol levels. As always, it's crucial to consult with healthcare professionals for personalized advice.\n\nI hope this information is helpful!

So, yes, 'although the cholesterol-raising effects brought about by the consumption of filtered coffee may not be as strong as those of the boiled coffee, it is important not to discard the possibility that filtered coffee may also play a small but important role in explaining the cholesterol-raising effects of coffee.' I had known about a study that found that three cups a day of filtered coffee raised total cholesterol, but the increase in 'bad' LDL cholesterol was not statistically significant, as you can see below and at 2:10 in my video. Researchers got the same results in another study, finding that subjects who stopped consumption of filtered coffee reduced their total cholesterol, which suggests that perhaps paper coffee filters only achieve partial cafestol removal. Had anyone ever just measured the levels of the cholesterol-raising compounds found in\n\t- stol removal. Had anyone ever just measured the levels of the cholesterol-raising compounds found in the paper filters? Indeed, researchers investigated just that and found most of the cholesterol-raising cafestol was retained by the coffee grounds, rather than actually getting stuck in the paper filter itself. In other words, 'the principal function' of the paper filter is not necessarily blocking the compound itself, but blocking any fine particles that are carrying the compound. This is similar to when you make French press coffee. When you depress that plunger with its fine mesh screen, you'll still get a little sludge at the bottom of the cup. That sludge is made up of the tiny particles that pass through the screen and can carry some of the risk. So, a little cafestol does get through the filter. As you can see below and at 3:07 in my video, you can cut out more than 90 percent of cafestol by switching from a French press or coffee maker with a metal mesh filter to one with a\n\t- of cafestol by switching from a French press or coffee maker with a metal mesh filter to one with a paper filter. If you use coffee that starts out with a high level of the cafestol compound, you're still clearing out about 95 percent with the paper filter, but could there still be enough left to bump up your LDL? You don't know until you...put it to the test. As you can see below and at 3:38 in my video, study subjects started out drinking a high-cafestol coffee, and after a month of drinking two cups a day, their LDL cholesterol increased significantly, even though the coffee was paper-filtered. So, if you have high cholesterol despite eating a healthy diet, you may want to try cutting out coffee and then getting retested. Or, you can try switching to a lower cafestol coffee. There are all sorts of variables that may affect cafestol levels, including roasting degree or grind size, and one can imagine a smaller particle size would allow for greater extraction. Since roasting appears\n2. Title 'Is Light or Dark Roast Coffee Healthier?' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/is-light-or-dark-roast-coffee-healthier/):\n\t- When it comes to reducing body weight, dark roast coffee is more effective than light roast coffee. If you drink non-paper-filtered coffee, such as boiled, French press, or Turkish coffee, you should know that the amount of cholesterol-raising compounds in the lightest roast coffee beans may be twice as high as in very dark roast coffee beans, as you can see at 0:07 in my video Which Coffee Is Healthier: Light vs. Dark Roast. It appears some of the cholesterol-raising compounds are destroyed by roasting, so, in this case, darker is better. (Alternatively, as I described in Does Coffee Affect Cholesterol?, you can use a paper filter and eliminate 95 percent of the cholesterol-raising activity of coffee regardless of the roast.) You may be familiar with another video of mine-Friday Favorite: Does Adding Milk Block the Benefits of Coffee?, which showed that dark roasting may also destroy up to nearly 90 percent of the chlorogenic acids, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory phytonutrients\n\n",

There are many ways to compare the healthfulness of different foods. For example, if you were interested in antioxidants you might compare vitamin C content. If you compared vitamin C content between our two most popular fruits, apples and bananas, then bananas would appear twice as healthy (10 mg in a banana compared to only 5mg in an apple). But vitamin C is just one of thousands of different phytonutrients in fruits and vegetables. It turns out the vitamin C in apples accounts for less than 1 percent of an apple's total antioxidant activity. In my 5-min video Which Fruit Fights Cancer Better?

If you drip water on these cancer cells as a control, nothing happens. They start out powering away at 100 percent growth and they keep powering away at 100 percent growth. And pineapples, pears, and oranges don't do much better. Peaches start pulling away from the pack. At high peach concentrations, cancer cell proliferation drops about 10 percent, but bananas and grapefruits appear to work four times better, dropping cancer growth rates by about 40 percent. Red grapes, strawberries and apples do even better, cutting cancer cell growth up to half at only half the dose, but the two fruits that won, causing a dramatic drop in cancer proliferation at just tiny doses, were lemons and cranberries. So if you look at the effective dose required to suppress liver cancer cell proliferation, apples are more powerful than bananas, but cranberries win the day.\n\t- range-red, red-purple, and pink-purple wild bananas, but none in domesticated yellow. In the Harvard researchers' defense, they just took values from the USDA, and it turns out USDA apparently made a mistake. There are no anthocyanins in store-bought bananas, and despite twice the vitamin C, bananas are beat out by apples in terms of overall antioxidant power. But that's just measuring the ability of these fruits to quench an oxidation reaction in a test tube. It would be nice to measure actual biological activity. In the red delicious apple study, researchers also measured the ability of apple extracts, from both peeled and unpeeled apples, to suppress the growth of human cancer cells growing in a petri dish compared to control.

It's considered unethical to withhold conventional cancer therapies to test out some fruit or vegetable, so what do you do? One direction researchers have taken is to use so-called 'combinatorial strategies,' for example adding phytonutrients from the spice turmeric and green tea along with chemotherapy to see if that works better than chemo alone, but this gets complicated because chemo and radiation often work by killing cancer cells with free radicals and so though antioxidants may certainly reduce the toxicity of the treatment there's a theoretical concern it could reduce the efficacy as well.

As I discuss in my video Duct Tape and Wart Removal, 'Duct tape brings out our inventive, slightly kooky side...Given this versatility, it wasn't so surprising a few years ago when a group of doctors...reported that duct tape could get rid of warts.'

Even though it was a randomized, controlled study, it wasn't a double-blinded one. 'Patients in the duct tape group were instructed to remove all tape prior to making a return clinic visit,' so the nurses measuring the wart changes wouldn't be biased one way or the other. Cryotherapy can cause redness, skin discoloration, crusting, and blisters, though, so the nurses may have had an idea which study participant was in which group, which may have biased them. So, ideally, there would be a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, and here we go.\n\t- Why do some experiments show that duct tape is ineffective for treating warts?

Research has found that people who avoid dairy throughout their lives have lower rates of breast and other cancers. One reason for this could be the presence of viruses in these animal-derived foods.\n\nA specific virus, called bovine leukemia virus (BLV), infects the mammary gland cells of cows and is released into the milk supply. Since most U.S. dairy herds are infected, scientists believe that Americans are often exposed to BLV. In 2003, researchers found evidence of BLV antibodies in human blood, suggesting a link between cow milk consumption and breast cancer risk.\n\nAdditionally, other viruses found in meat and dairy, such as polyomaviruses, have been linked to human cancers like colon, lung, and breast cancer. These viruses can survive cooking and pasteurization processes, making it crucial to be aware of their potential presence in these products.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that correlation does not imply causation, and more research is needed to establish a direct causal relationship. Nevertheless, avoiding meat and dairy and consuming a plant-based diet may help reduce cancer risk.\n\nFor more information, check out these blog posts:\n- [The Role of Meat and Dairy Viruses in Cancer](https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/the-role-of-meat-and-dairy-viruses-in-cancer/)\n- [Cow Cancer Virus Implicated in Breast Cancer](https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/cow-cancer-virus-implicated-in-breast-cancer/)\n- [Do Poultry Viruses Cause Human Cancers?](https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/do-poultry-viruses-cause-human-cancers/)\n\nPlease consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. \ud83d\ude0a",

Seven viruses are now conclusively tied to human cancers, and, as new viruses enter into human populations, the incidence and causes of cancer will likely change accordingly. The foundation of modern tumor virology was laid more than a century ago with the discovery of a cancer-causing chicken virus, for which a Nobel Prize was awarded. Another Nobel Prize went to the 'medical doctor-turned-virologist' who discovered that the HPV virus was causing cervical cancer. In his acceptance speech, he mused that there may be a bovine polyoma virus-a multiple tumor virus in cattle-that could be playing a role in human colon cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer, but no polyoma virus had ever been discovered in meat...until now.

In a study, researchers replaced animal fat in participants' diets with either carbohydrates, avocado, or vegetable oils with a similar fat profile to avocados.

When a headline reads 'Avocados could improve your cholesterol-and more,' the article and others like it are largely talking about substitution experiments, where avocado is added to the diet as a replacement for animal fats. In that case, it's no wonder cholesterol goes down. Dairy and poultry are the two greatest contributors of cholesterol-raising saturated fat intake, so if you take people eating a standard North American diet including animal fats, they may start out with an LDL cholesterol level up around 95mg/dl. If you add avocado to their diet without doing anything else, their cholesterol does not go down; instead, it may go up to around 105mg/dl. If you add avocado while reducing saturated fat intake, though, cholesterol falls to about 90mg/dl-but that drop isn't very different from what you'd get by just reducing saturated fat and adding nothing, which was shown to give\n\t-  helped even more than merely skipping meat, and it may help more effectively with the worst type of bad LDL cholesterol, small, dense LDL. Oatmeal, oat bran, walnuts, and a plant-based diet rich in fiber and nuts have all been shown to cause LDL to lower overall and the more dangerous, small LDL, specifically, but this was not seen with extra-virgin olive oil, suggesting it is not only a monounsaturated fat effect. Researchers removed animal fat from subjects' diets and replaced it with either carbohydrates, avocado, or vegetable oils with similar fat profiles to avocados and found that replacing the animal fat with the whole plant food avocado had the best results in reducing LDL. All three treatments lowered large LDL, but avocado had the added effect of also lowering the more dangerous small LDL.\n\t- erent from what you'd get by just reducing saturated fat and adding nothing, which was shown to give an LDL under 90mg/dl, as you can see at 0:34 in my video Avocados Lower Small Dense LDL Cholesterol. What if you compared the effects of eating no meat at all with a meat-free diet that included avocado? Researchers took people with sky-high cholesterol levels up around 300mg/dl and switched them to either a relatively low-fat vegetarian diet with about 20 percent of calories from fat or a vegetarian diet with added avocado that took it up about 30 percent of calories from fat, which is a more typical fat content. As you can see at 1:22 in my video, the study participants started out with LDLs through the roof, and, while cutting out meat may have helped, cutting out meat and adding avocado seemed to help even more-and it may help best with the worst type of LDL. As I've touched on before, all LDL cholesterol is bad cholesterol. However, large, fluffy LDL may only increase the odds of\n\t- erent from what you'd get by just reducing saturated fat and adding nothing, which was shown to give an LDL under 90mg/dl, as you can see at 0:34 in my video Avocados Lower Small Dense LDL Cholesterol.

However, large, fluffy LDL may only increase the odds of cardiac events such as heart attacks by 31 percent, whereas small, dense LDL is even worse and increases the odds by 44 percent. If you feed people a lot of oatmeal and oat bran, not only does that cause their LDL to go down overall, but it specifically brings down the small LDL, the worst of the worst. What happens if you add walnuts to a low-fat diet? As you can see at 2:04 in my video, LDL goes down and, at the same time, the size distribution of the LDL shifts to be a little more benign. What if you put people on a plant-based diet with lots of fiber and nuts? As shown as 2:15 in my video, you can get a massive 30 percent drop in LDL, a drop that is comparable to a cholesterol-lowering statin drug. What's more, this includes a drop in the small, dense LDL, which is the most dangerous. This does not happen with extra-virgin olive oil, however, so it's not just a monounsaturated fat\n\t- s. This does not happen with extra-virgin olive oil, however, so it's not just a monounsaturated fat effect. In the famous PREDIMED study, which you can see at 2:35 in my video, those randomized to the extra nuts group got a significant drop in the smallest, densest LDL, but those randomized to the extra-virgin olive oil group did not. So, there appears to be some special components in nuts that lowers the worst of the worst LDL cholesterol. Do avocados offer similar benefits? We didn't know until the first randomized controlled feeding trial to look at avocados and LDL size. The researchers removed animal fat from people's diet and replaced it with either carbohydrates, avocado, or vegetable oils that had a similar fat profile to the avocados. In this way, the avocado group and the vegetable oil group were put on very similar diets, except one had the nutrients unique to avocados and the other did not. What happened? Any time you lower intake of saturated fat, such as replacing\n\t- and the other did not. What happened? Any time you lower intake of saturated fat, such as replacing animal fat with plant fat (vegetable oil in this case) or carbohydrates, you're going to bring down LDL. Okay, but does replacing animal fat with the whole plant food avocado make a difference? Yes. That resulted in an even better effect. To see why, the researchers broke the LDL down into large versus small. All three treatments brought down the dangerous large LDL, but the avocado had the additional effect of also bringing down the super dangerous small LDL. That's where that extra drop came from.

Indeed, simply adding avocado may confer no benefits to cholesterol at all. So, yes, the avocado industry is right in saying that avocados are a more healthful substitute for butter, margarine, cheese, or cream cheese, but that's a pretty low bar. According to William C. Roberts, editor in chief of the American Journal of Cardiology, the only critical risk factor for atherosclerotic plaque buildup is cholesterol, specifically elevated LDL cholesterol in our blood. To drastically reduce LDL cholesterol levels, it appears we need to drastically reduce our intake of: Aside from being rich in phytosterols, what else can we get from avocados? Within hours of eating a burger topped with half an avocado, the level of an inflammatory biomarker goes up in your blood-but not as high as it does if you eat the burger without the avocado. This may be because avocados and all other whole\n\t- our intake of cholesterol-raising foods. See: Compared with all other fruits, avocados contain more phytosterols, the cholesterol-lowering nutrient found in plant foods, but phytosterols are fat-soluble and most fruits are very low in fat, so it isn't surprising that avocados top the chart. When comparing phytosterol content of avocados, chocolate, nuts, and seeds, to scale, nuts and seeds have the highest levels overall and even chocolate has roughly twice the phytosterols as avocados. So-called bad LDL cholesterol may be lowered with doses of phytosterols equivalent to around 20 avocados or a single ounce of nuts (around a palmful) a day. Most studies showing that cholesterol drops when a daily avocado is consumed, rises when they are no longer eaten, and then falls once more when they're resumed did not only add avocado to the subjects' diets, but they swapped out animal fat, so it's no wonder cholesterol went down with avocado consumption.

Or to those who have an early stage of squamous cell carcinoma skin cancer caused by arsenic exposure, or early stage cervical cancer, or precancerous lesions in the mouth or stomach? Researchers did this, and in about a quarter of the patients, the lesions started to get better. One out of the two bladder cancer survivors, two out of seven patients with precancerous mouth lesions, one out of six patients with precancerous stomach lesions, one out of four early stage cervical cancer cases, and two out of six patients with early stage skin cancer, all without any noticeable side-effects. One of the reasons turmeric curcumin may work in some cancers better than others, or in some people better than others, is differences in bioavailability.

It makes sense to take turmeric orally to try to fight colon cancer, but if we have cancer erupting on our skin, why not just rub it on directly? That's what one group of researchers did. They took some turmeric from the store, made a tincture out of it, dried it, put it in Vaseline, and then had cancer patients rub it on their cancer three times a day. What kind of cancer can you get at with a finger? These were folks with cancers of the mouth, breast, skin, vulva, and elsewhere. Isn't breast cancer under the surface? Not always. Advanced breast cancer can ulcerate right through the skin. The subjects were all people with recurrent ulcerating tumors that had failed to respond to surgery, radiation, and chemo.

Most clinical studies treating diseases in people have used curcumin supplements, as opposed to turmeric, but none has tried using turmeric components other than curcumin, even though curcumin-free turmeric exhibits anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities.

When comparing phytosterol content of avocados, chocolate, nuts, and seeds, to scale, nuts and seeds have the highest levels overall and even chocolate has roughly twice the phytosterols as avocados. So-called bad LDL cholesterol may be lowered with doses of phytosterols equivalent to around 20 avocados or a single ounce of nuts (around a palmful) a day. Most studies showing that cholesterol drops when a daily avocado is consumed, rises when they are no longer eaten, and then falls once more when they're resumed did not only add avocado to the subjects' diets, but they swapped out animal fat, so it's no wonder cholesterol went down with avocado consumption. Removing saturated fat from the diet and\n\t- 300; and almonds, almond butter, flaxseeds, and macadamia nuts around 200. Even chocolate has about twice as many phytosterols as avocados, as you can see at 0:51 in my video Are Avocados Good for Your Cholesterol?. Even though nuts and seeds have such high levels of phytosterols, the studies that have been done on lowering so-called bad LDL cholesterol with phytosterols have used supplements starting with 600 milligrams and going up into the thousands of milligrams. So, yes, you can lower LDL cholesterol by about 8 percent with a dose of phytosterols around 2,100 milligrams, but that would be about 20 avocados a day, as you can see at 1:17 in my video. And 2,100 milligrams of phytosterols would also be a lot of nuts, but you can get an 8 percent drop in LDL by just eating a palmful of nuts, just a single ounce a day, as you can see in the graph below and at 1:36 in my video. So, phytosterols aren't the only components of nuts responsible for driving down cholesterol. Nuts must have\n\t- Cholesterol is a vital component of our cells, which is why our body makes all that we need. Elevated cholesterol in our blood is implicated in many serious health concerns. We know that many whole-food sources of fat, like nuts, can lower our levels. What about avocados? Can we dig into some guacamole and get cholesterol-lowering benefits, or is that just spin by the avocado industry? For most Americans eating a conventional diet, plaque accumulates inside the coronary arteries that feed our heart muscle. This plaque buildup, known as atherosclerosis, is the hardening of the arteries by pockets of cholesterol-rich fatty material that builds up beneath the inner linings of the blood vessels. This process seems to occur over decades, slowly bulging into the space inside the arteries, narrowing the path in which our blood flows. Restriction of blood circulation to the heart may lead to chest pain and pressure when we try to exert ourselves. If the plaque ruptures, a blood clot may form\n\t- s no wonder cholesterol went down with avocado consumption. Removing saturated fat from the diet and substituting in avocados may lead to a significant drop in cholesterol and triglycerides, but simply adding avocado without also reducing saturated animal fat intake does not appear to result in any benefits to cholesterol.\n2.

This does not happen with extra-virgin olive oil, however, so it's not just a monounsaturated fat effect. In the famous PREDIMED study, which you can see at 2:35 in my video, those randomized to the extra nuts group got a significant drop in the smallest, densest LDL, but those randomized to the extra-virgin olive oil group did not. So, there appears to be some special components in nuts that lowers the worst of the worst LDL cholesterol. Do avocados offer similar benefits? We didn't know until the first randomized controlled feeding trial to look at avocados and LDL size. The researchers removed animal fat from people's diet and replaced it with either carbohydrates, avocado, or vegetable oils that had a similar fat profile to the avocados. In this way, the avocado group and the vegetable oil group were put on very similar diets, except one had the nutrients unique to avocados and the other did not. What happened? Any time you lower intake of saturated fat, such as replacing\n\t- What are the effects of oatmeal, walnuts, extra virgin olive oil, and avocados on LDL cholesterol size? When a headline reads 'Avocados could improve your cholesterol-and more,' the article and others like it are largely talking about substitution experiments, where avocado is added to the diet as a replacement for animal fats. In that case, it's no wonder cholesterol goes down. Dairy and poultry are the two greatest contributors of cholesterol-raising saturated fat intake, so if you take people eating a standard North American diet including animal fats, they may start out with an LDL cholesterol level up around 95mg/dl. If you add avocado to their diet without doing anything else, their cholesterol does not go down; instead, it may go up to around 105mg/dl. If you add avocado while reducing saturated fat intake, though, cholesterol falls to about 90mg/dl-but that drop isn't very different from what you'd get by just reducing saturated fat and adding nothing, which was shown to give\n\t- erent from what you'd get by just reducing saturated fat and adding nothing, which was shown to give an LDL under 90mg/dl, as you can see at 0:34 in my video Avocados Lower Small Dense LDL Cholesterol. What if you compared the effects of eating no meat at all with a meat-free diet that included avocado? Researchers took people with sky-high cholesterol levels up around 300mg/dl and switched them to either a relatively low-fat vegetarian diet with about 20 percent of calories from fat or a vegetarian diet with added avocado that took it up about 30 percent of calories from fat, which is a more typical fat content. As you can see at 1:22 in my video, the study participants started out with LDLs through the roof, and, while cutting out meat may have helped, cutting out meat and adding avocado seemed to help even more-and it may help best with the worst type of LDL. As I've touched on before, all LDL cholesterol is bad cholesterol. However, large, fluffy LDL may only increase the odds of\n3.

The flipside? 'A diet low in cholesterol may play a role in the prevention of several cancers.' This means cutting down on meat, dairy, and eggs, the very foods that may increase risk of cancer. 'Thus, the findings of this study should essentially be viewed as an indication that a diet rich in meat, dairy products, eggs (and hence animal fat) is an unfavorable indicator of the risk of several common cancers...'

In the 1970s, this relationship was extended to include breast cancer, too, and animal fat was implicated as well. Animal protein and dietary cholesterol kind of travel together in the same foods.

So, is dietary cholesterol co-carcinogenic for human colon cancer? Researchers decided to try to find out by feeding some to rats. In one study, researchers injected rats with a carcinogen, and the cholesterol-eating rats got tumors in half the time and they all died, whereas most of the rats in the cholesterol-free group survived. But 'the relevance of animal data to the human situation is debatable.' How would the cholesterol and cancer link even work? As humans, we don't need to consume any cholesterol, since our body makes all that it needs. When we do consume extra cholesterol, there's a limit to the amount our body can absorb. So, 'where does the excess go?' Down to our colon. In this way, the cells lining our colon, where colon cancer arises, 'are therefore constantly exposed to\n\t- excess cholesterol goes down to our colon and may help cancerous or precancerous polyps grow faster.

So, something like a daily omelet might increase endometrial cancer risk by about 20 percent. This may be because the extra cholesterol is converted into estrogen, or it may just be because the increased oxidative stress is reflected in higher levels of oxidized cholesterol. I talk about this in my video Oxidized Cholesterol as a Cause of Alzheimer's Disease. There also appears to be a dose-response relationship with pancreatic cancer, 'one of the most dismal malignancies.' A compilation of studies found the risk of pancreatic cancer increased by 8 percent for every 100 mg of cholesterol, so that would be about a 30 percent higher risk for a daily omelet.

Why is that? One thought is the 'prolonged ingestion of a cholesterol-enriched diet induces chronic, auto-inflammatory responses resulting in significant health problems including colorectal cancer,' and we know that 'chronic nonresolving inflammation leads to the initiation, promotion, and progression of tumor development.' As you can see in the graph below and at 1:12 in my video, sprinkling some cholesterol on white blood cells in a test tube can trigger the release of inflammatory compounds, and LDL cholesterol can induce breast cancer proliferation and invasion, but that's in vitro. In a petri dish, you can show that breast cancer cells can migrate nearly twice as far within a day in the presence of LDL cholesterol, but what happens in people? The level of LDL cholesterol in the blood\n\t- . Lowering cholesterol with diet may be able to give us the best of both worlds. Animal studies show that if you feed cholesterol to mice, you can accelerate their cancers, 'but extrapolation to humans is difficult as dietary cholesterol has limited effect on blood cholesterol levels in humans.' Thus, dietary cholesterol might just be 'indicative of a lifestyle prone to health-related problems, including cancer'-that is, maybe people are just more likely to have an after-meal cigarette if that meal is bacon and eggs compared to oatmeal. It was difficult to imagine how dietary cholesterol alone could promote cancer development, but that changed recently with the discovery that 27-hydroxycholesterol, '27HC, a metabolite of cholesterol, can function as an estrogen and increase the proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells.' So, it's not the cholesterol itself, but what the cholesterol turns into inside our body. 'Scientists have long struggled to understand why\n3.

In statistical parlance, one would say that a cross-sectional study doesn't have the power for detecting such a relationship. Thus, because of that variability, these kinds of observational studies would seem an inappropriate method to study this particular relationship. So, since diet and serum cholesterol have a zero correlation cross-sectionally, an observational study of the relationship between diet and coronary heart disease incidence will suffer from the same difficulties. So again, if you do the math, observational studies would unavoidably show nearly no correlation between saturated fat and heart disease. These prospective studies can be valuable for other diseases, but the appropriate design demonstrating or refuting the role of diet and coronary heart disease is a dietary change experiment. And those dietary change experiments have been done; they implicate saturated fat, hence the lower saturated guidelines from basically every major medical\n\n",

Give strawberries for six weeks to people with diabetes, and not only does their diabetes get better, but their level of C-reactive protein, which is a marker of systemic inflammation, also drops by 18 percent, as you can see at 3:32 in my video. Even a single meal can help. As you can see below and at 3:46 in my video, if people eat a largely unhealthy breakfast, their level of inflammatory markers goes up over the next six hours-but less so if just five large strawberries are added to the meal. So, can strawberries improve pain and inflammation in confirmed knee osteoarthritis?

How might berries improve human health, healthy aging, and quality of life? It may be due to their anti-inflammatory effects, since inflammation can be an underlying contributing factor in the 'development, progression, and complication' of a number of chronic diseases. As I discuss in my video Berries for Inflammation and Osteoarthritis Treatment, higher intake of anthocyanins-the brightly colored pigments in berries-has been associated with anti-inflammatory effects, which 'may be a key component' underlying the associated reduction in chronic disease risk. But these are all just associations. You can't prove cause and effect until you put it to the test.

That's all well and good, but what about using berries to treat inflammatory diseases like arthritis? Yes, they may have protective effects against arthritis in a rat, significantly reducing 'paw volume'-how swollen their paws get when injected with some inflammatory irritant, as you can see in the graph below and at 3:06 in my video-but there had never been any human arthritis berry studies until now.

If it's an inflammatory reaction, then might anti-inflammatory phytonutrients help? The bioflavonoids in citrus might help with the lactic acid buildup, but we may need to ramp up to the anthocyanin flavonoids in berries to deal with the inflammation.

Research has focused mainly on cancer prevention and treatment. Studies show that the anticancer effects of berries are partially mediated through their abilities to counteract, reduce, and also repair damage resulting from oxidative stress and inflammation. Berries may also have many other positive effects, such as boosting detoxifying enzymes. One of the more remarkable effects is that of blueberries on natural killer cell counts. Natural killer cells are part of our immune system's rapid response team against cancer cells, eliminating cancer cells through the activation of cancer cell suicide via death receptors. They're called natural killers because they don't require activation by prior exposure. We don't want to wait until our second tumor before our immune system starts fighting. We have about two billion of these soldiers circulating in our blood stream at any one time, but we\n4.

However, during a year drinking soy milk, 6 out of the 20 subjects got better, 2 got worse, and the remaining 12 remained unchanged, as you can see from 5:02 in my video. So, they concluded that soy food may help in a subset of patients. Based on all these studies, the results Ornish and his colleagues got were probably due to more than just the soy.

What are some strategies to reduce arsenic exposure from rice? Arsenic, a naturally occurring element, has been designated as a category one carcinogen, which is the highest level. Most of the arsenic in the American diet may come from meat. Drugs containing arsenic are often fed to farm animals to kill their intestinal parasites. During the cooking process, the arsenic residues in their flesh can convert to inorganic arsenic that we then may consume when we eat meat. Arsenic accumulates, along with many other banned chemicals, and slaughterhouse byproducts can be recycled as animal feed. Fish may also have high levels of arsenic. One type of seaweed, hijiki (also commonly spelled as hiziki), absorbs so much arsenic from the sea water that it is not safe to eat.

And, indeed, they clearly demonstrated that eating a lot of arsenic-contaminated rice every day can 'give rise to significant amounts of genetic damage,' the kind that's associated with cancer. Yes, but the study used pretty contaminated rice.

This marked the first demonstration that green tea compounds could be 'very effective for treating premalignant lesions before [prostate cancer] develops.' Even a year later, after the subjects stopped the green tea, nearly 90 percent of the original green tea group remained cancer-free, while more than half of the placebo group developed cancer, as you can see at 2:09 in my video. This suggests that the benefits of the green tea may be 'long-lasting,' with an overall nearly 80 percent reduction in prostate cancer. What if you already have prostate cancer? A proprietary green tea extract supplement was given to 26 men with confirmed prostate cancer for an average of about a month before they had their prostates removed, and there was a significant reduction in a number of cancer biomarkers such as PSA levels, suggesting a shrinkage of the tumor. However, there was no control group, and the study was funded by the supplement company itself.

It certainly didn't seem to help for advanced metastatic cancer in the two studies that tried it. What's more, doubt has recently been cast on the precancerous results. When researchers tried to replicate it, the green tea extract group only seemed to cut prostate cancer development about in half, which very well may have happened just by chance, given the small number of people in the study.

NF-kB is thought to be a prognostic marker for prostate cancer progression, so the green tea did appear to work better than the black tea.

Title 'What Is the Science on Cannabis?' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/what-is-the-science-on-cannabis/):\n\t- What did the National Academies of Sciences' 468-page report conclude about cannabis? When some misinformed people hear of the grand opening of a new plant-based medical practice, one plant in particular may come to mind. I've gotten a lot of questions about cannabis over the years, and I figure it's high time to try to clear the haze. I didn't want to just take a pot shot, just a tokin' effort, and end up with a half-baked puff piece. There are burning issues about a growing industry. With so much buzz and smoke and mirrors, the science can really take a hit. Are there acute chronic effects? Perhaps blunt trauma from impaired driving? I wanted to give the straight dope and weed out any doobie-ous research. It's been quite a trip. In fact, 420 articles were published within just a few months! My video The Institute of Medicine Report on the Health Effects of Marijuana dives into the review everyone was waiting for: the 2017 'current state of evidence' from the Institute of Medicine\n\t- emphysema, which you can get from smoking tobacco. Similarly, it doesn't look like smoking marijuana increases the risk of respiratory cancers, such as lung cancer or head and neck cancer, though cannabis may increase the risk of testicular cancer. There have been three studies so far on marijuana use and testicular cancer. As you can see at 3:10 in my video, marijuana appears to increase risk about 50 percent, but only, it seems, for those smoking once a week or more, or for ten years or longer. What did the Institute of Medicine conclude overall in its 468-page report? Were they for legalization, or opposed? Basically, they concluded that there simply isn't enough research, 'leaving patients, health care professionals, and policy makers without the evidence they need to make sound decisions regarding the use of cannabis and cannabinoids' either way. Further, 'this lack of evidence-based information...poses a public health risk.' The one thing everyone on both sides 'can agree [on]\n3.

They do this by distorting research findings, co-opting policy makers and health professionals, and lobbying politicians and public officials.' In his book about his fight with the tobacco industry, former FDA commissioner David Kessler recounted similar strong-arm tactics used by the meat industry to try to squash nutrition regulations. The Supreme Court's Citizens United decision allowing corporations to spend unlimited amounts on political ads during election campaigns could make things even worse by working against candidates who support public health positions. 'Another similarity between tobacco and food companies is the introduction and heavy marketing of 'safer' or 'healthier' products.

Title 'Egg Industry Caught Making False Claims' (URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/egg-industry-caught-making-false-claims/):\n\t- On the basis of concerns from the American Heart Association and consumer groups, the Federal Trade Commission carried out successful legal action-upheld by the Supreme Court-to compel the egg industry to cease and desist from false and misleading advertising that eggs had no harmful effects on health. Over the years, cholesterol concerns resulted in severe economic loss through a reduction in egg consumption, so the egg industry created a 'National Commission on Egg Nutrition' to combat the public health warnings with ads that said things like 'There is no scientific evidence whatsoever that eating eggs in any way increases the risk of heart attack.' The U.S. Court of Appeals found such outright deception patently false and misleading. Even the tobacco industry wasn't that brazen, trying only to introduce the element of doubt, arguing that the relationship between smoking and health remains an open question. In contrast, the egg ads made seven claims, each of which was determined by\n5.

Colorado recently suffered some high profile recalls of marijuana batches contaminated with harmful pesticides that made it into some of the edibles. Evidently, 'growers sometimes find themselves quite overwhelmed by pest issues...[and] resort to nuclear tactics,' trying anything to protect their crops. This has created 'a public safety threat,' with 'intensified toxicity in concentrated products of particular concern.' In fact, 'pesticide levels were approximately 10x higher in concentrated cannabis products,' like the oils and waxes sometimes used in edibles or dabbed as concentrates, 'than the flower heads.' A study of pesticide use on cannabis crops in Oregon found a similar problem. A survey of samples off of store shelves in Washington state found five out of six to be contaminated, including with 'potentially neurotoxic and carcinogenic agents.' Many samples 'harbored multiple contaminants,'\n\n",

Each year in the United States, approximately 60,000 new cases are diagnosed, bringing the total number of current cases up to about a million, with tens of thousands of people dying from the disease every year. The dietary component most often implicated is milk, as I discuss in my video Could Lactose Explain the Milk and Parkinson's Disease Link?, and contamination of milk by neurotoxins has been considered the 'only possible explanation.' High levels of organochlorine pesticide residues have been found in milk, as well as in the most affected areas in the brains of Parkinson's victims on autopsy. Pesticides in milk have been found around the world, so perhaps the dairy industry should require toxin screenings of milk. In fact, inexpensive, sensitive, portable tests are now available with no false positives and no false negatives, providing rapid detection of highly toxic pesticides in milk. Now, we\n\t- itives and no false negatives, providing rapid detection of highly toxic pesticides in milk. Now, we just have to convince the dairy industry to actually do it. Others are not as convinced of the pesticide link. 'Despite clear-cut associations between milk intake and PD [Parkinson's disease] incidence, there is no rational explanation for milk being a risk factor for PD.' If it were the pesticides present in milk that could accumulate in the brain, we would assume that the pesticides would build up in the fat. However, the link between skimmed milk and Parkinson's is just as strong. So, researchers have suggested reverse causation: The milk didn't cause Parkinson's; the Parkinson's caused the milk. Parkinson's makes some people depressed, they reasoned, and depressed people may drink more milk. As such, they suggested we shouldn't limit dairy intake for people with Parkinson's, especially because they are so susceptible to hip fractures. But we now know that milk doesn't appear to\n\t- ociated with more milk than cheese-more oxidative stress and inflammation-we should think galactose, the milk sugar rather than the milk fat, protein, or pesticides. That's why we think milk drinkers specifically appeared to have a higher risk of bone fractures and death, which may explain the neurodegeneration findings, too. Not only do rare individuals with an inability to detoxify the galactose found in milk suffer damage to their bones, but they also exhibit damage to their brains.

What about avoiding pesticides and other industrial pollutants? A recent autopsy study found higher levels in the brains of Parkinson's victims of certain PCBs found in Monsanto's Aroclor, which was banned in 1979. The more PCBs found in the brain, the worse the brain damage. The worst three appeared to be PCBs 138, 153, and 180, all of which are significantly lower in the bodies of those eating plant-based diets. So, does a vegan diet reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease?

The general recommendations to increase the intake of these fats should consider its potential risks. How could eating more fish or fish oil increase cancer risk? Well, there are some industrial pollutants, like PCBs, linked to increased prostate cancer risk, and the 'primary source of exposure in the general population is believed to be through diet from fish, meat, and dairy products.'

As you can see from 1:43 in my video Can Vitamin C Help with Lead Poisoning?, the amount of lead in a painter's urine over a period of a month after starting 200 mg of vitamin C\n\t- 0 percent lower prevalence of elevated blood lead levels compared to those with the lowest vitamin C levels. Now, this was a cross-sectional study, just a snapshot in time, so we don't know if the vitamin C caused a drop in lead or if perhaps the lead caused a drop in vitamin C. Lead is a pro-oxidant, so maybe it ate up the vitamin C. And who has higher vitamin C levels? Those who can afford to have higher vitamin C levels and eat lots of fruits and vegetables. 'It is also possible that higher ascorbic acid levels may represent healthier lifestyles or greater socio-economic status.' Indeed, maybe lower vitamin C levels are just a proxy for being poor, and that's the real reason for higher lead levels. There are lots of good reasons to be eating more fruits and vegetables, and we should be eating more spinach regardless, but it would be nice to know if vitamin C actually helps with lead poisoning. And, to know that, we need to put it to the test. Unfortunately, most of the published\n\t- l cover in Yellow Bell Peppers for Male Infertility and Lead Poisoning?. I'm always conflicted about writing these kinds of blogs and producing videos like Can Vitamin C Help with Lead Poisoning?. I can imagine some just want 'the answer,' but those with vested and commercial interests often exploit that natural impulse. This is problem with science in general, but perhaps particularly in nutrition. When it comes to something as life-or-death important as what to feed ourselves and our families we shouldn't just follow someone's opinions or beliefs on the matter. We should demand to see the science. That's what I try to do: Present the available data as fairly and even-handedly as possible, and let you make up your own mind. You can imagine how easily someone could cherry-pick just one or two studies and present a distorted but compelling case for or against, in this case, vitamin C supplements. That's why I feel it's important to present each study in their historical context.

(URL: https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/vitamin-c-for-male-infertility-and-lead-poisoning/):\n\t- mentation on blood and hair levels of cadmium, lead, and mercury' are so important. Vitamin C versus an identical-looking sugar pill placebo. The result? The vitamin C failed to help, which really put a damper on enthusiasm for using vitamin C for lead poisoning until a now-famous study was published in 1999 that showed that vitamin C supplementation could lead to a decrease in blood levels. As you can see at 4:32 in my video, after four weeks of taking a placebo, not much change occurred in blood lead levels in the control group, which is what we'd expect. In contrast, the vitamin C group started out at about the same blood lead level as the control group, but within one week of taking 1,000 mg of vitamin C a day, lead levels dropped 81 percent. So, supplementation of vitamin C 'may provide an economical and convenient method of reducing blood-lead levels, possibly by reducing the intestinal absorption of lead.' The urine lead levels didn't change, so it's not as if the subjects were\n\t- all study found the same 30 percent drop with just 500 mg a day, no zinc, and in only one month. But neither of those studies had a control group of subjects who didn't take anything, so we don't know if their levels would have fallen anyway. Similarly, there is an almost too-good-to-be-true study on the role of vitamin C in scavenging lead toxicity from 'biosystems,' by which they meant children. They got 250 to 500 mg a day of vitamin C for a few months, and shaved hair samples every month saw up to a 69 percent decline in lead levels. Researchers repeated it in two other small groups of kids and saw the same amazing kind of drops in every single child. But maybe lead levels were just dropping throughout the whole community during that time? Without measuring lead levels in a control group of kids not taking vitamin C, we can't be sure.

One could conclude that the vitamin C was pulling lead out of the body, but the same thing happened in the placebo group: Blood levels dropped, and urine levels rose. So, it had nothing to do with the vitamin C at all. That's why it's always important to have a control group. The same applies with studies that appeared to show no benefit. For example, 36 battery manufacturing workers were studied. Each was given vitamin C, yet there was no change in their lead levels. But, maybe their co-workers suffered a big increase in lead levels during that same time period, and the vitamin C was actually successful in keeping the subjects' levels from rising. You don't know without a control group. That's why studies like 'The effects of vitamin C supplementation on blood and hair levels of cadmium, lead, and mercury' are so important.

Remember how chelation drugs can lower blood levels in chronic lead poisoning, but they don't actually improve neurological function? Well, after treatment with garlic, significant clinical improvements were seen, including less irritability, fewer headaches, and improvements in reflexes and blood pressure, but these improvements were not seen in the drug group. They weren't seen after treatment with the chelation therapy drug. So, garlic was safer and more effective. 'Therefore, garlic can be recommended for the treatment of mild-to-moderate lead poisoning. There are also some human studieson vitamin C. Check out Can Vitamin C Help with Lead Poisoning?. For even more lead videos, see: To learn more about chlorella, see:\n\n",
