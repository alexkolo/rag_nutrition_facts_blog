        "Show off your healthy lifestyle while supporting NutritionFacts.org.

        "A butterfly-shaped gland found low on the front of the neck, the thyroid is part of the endocrine system, which is made up of glands that produce, store, and release hormones into the bloodstream. Thyroid hormones primarily influence our metabolism, growth, development, and body temperature. I recently did a webinar on iodine and thyroid function, and those videos are now all out on NutritionFacts.org. Watch them-and learn more about thyroid health-here.",
        "Dal is a staple in Indian cuisine and packed with rich spices. This bright meal is flavored with ginger, cumin, coriander, and turmeric. It is both warm and comforting, but light enough to be enjoyed all year round. Serve it over whole grains to check off several Daily Dozen items in one meal. You can find the recipe here, and a video on how it's made here.",
        "Dan and Nick recently joined our team and are responsible for day-to-day technical tasks, including development, maintenance, and administration of the NutritionFacts.org website to help bring you the latest in clinical nutrition.",
        "Dan has degrees in computer science and completed his doctoral research on machine learning, though his career has focused on web development. He has been a plant-based eater since 2016 and can often be found in the kitchen with his daughter, proving what is good for you tastes great, too. Dan lives in northern California with his wife, daughter, and two dogs.",
        "Nick is a full-stack web developer. When he's not developing websites and web apps, he enjoys learning French, reading up on global politics, and animal rights activism. He spends most of his time between Florida and the United Kingdom.\n \n \n \nVitamin D Infographic\nIs it necessary to take vitamin D supplements? Vitamin D is made mostly by animals, including ourselves, when we're exposed to sunlight. Based on randomized, controlled studies, it may help us enjoy a healthier life. If you don't get adequate sun exposure, I recommend 2,000 IU vitamin D supplements daily, ideally with the largest meal of the day. You can now get a summary of my vitamin D information in a printable, shareable infographic when you subscribe to our emails. \n \n \nMeghan's Health Story \nI was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer at age 38. Genetic testing showed no predisposition, and my General Practitioner asked if that left me with more questions than answers. It did! I told her I had cut out red meat at the suggestion of my oncologist. She said, 'That's great! Keep going; in fact...cut out the white meat, dairy, and eggs.' Of course I asked, 'What would I eat?!!' Then she asked me if I had heard of TMAO, and she wrote that down on a post-it, along with NutritionFacts.org.\nWatching the videos on TMAO and other topics really helped me. I saw that if my diet could do this to me, it could fix me too! I also read Dr. Greger's book, How Not to Die. I had phenomenal, unbelievable success by implementing the dietary changes I was originally afraid of, and I am 3 years still cancer free. \n \n\n \nThe Healthiest Natural Source of Iodine\nHow much nori, dulse, or arame approximate the recommended daily allowance for iodine?\n \n \nThe Best Diet for Hypothyroidism and Hyperthyroidism\nIs the apparent protection of plant-based diets for thyroid health due to the exclusion of animal foods, the benefits of plant foods, or both?\n \n \nBenefits of Black Cumin Seed for Weight Loss\nFor three cents a day, black cumin may improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels, blood pressure, and blood sugar control, as well as accelerate the loss of body fat.\n \n \nNext Live Q&A on July 22\nMy once-monthly live Q&As are now going bi-monthly. Don't worry, though. It's only temporary while I focus my time on researching and writing my next book, How Not to Age (coming out in 2022). Join me for the next Q&A on July 22.\nJoin on our Facebook page or YouTube channel at 3pm ET. I'll be streaming to both at the same time!\nYou can find links to past live Q&As here on NutritionFacts.org. If that's not enough, don't forget I have an audio podcast to keep you company, too.\n \nIn health,\nMichael Greger, M.D.\nPS: If you haven't yet, you can subscribe to my free videos here and watch my live, year-in-review presentations:\n\n2019: Evidence-Based Weight Loss\n2016: How Not To Die: The Role of Diet in Preventing, Arresting, and Reversing Our Top 15 Killers\n2015: Food as Medicine: Preventing and Treating the Most Dreaded Diseases with Diet\n2014: From Table to Able: Combating Disabling Diseases with Food\n2013: More Than an Apple a Day\n2012: Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death",
