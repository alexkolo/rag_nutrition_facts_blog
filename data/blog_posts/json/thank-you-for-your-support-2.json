        "'I started volunteering at NutritionFacts about five years ago after following Dr. Greger for a while. I thought that the science and the information on NutritionFacts was crucial for helping others and for our own wellbeing. I believe it should be easily accessible globally in every language possible, so I decided to join the Spanish-English Translation Team. I really enjoy being part of the team and have learned so much. Currently, I'm the NutritionFacts YouTube Comments Moderator. I'm still learning a lot and I'm loving it!",
        "Since I was a child, my favorite plant-based meal has been a big, fresh green salad. I literally used to fight with my sister over who got the biggest portion and my mom always got a kick out of the fact that we didn't fight over candy, we fought over lettuce salad!'",
        "Next week we will be launching our new free email series on plant-based living. This 10-week series will include topics like my traffic light system, disease prevention, healthy food swaps, menu planning tools, and more. Keep your eyes out for our Top Ten of 2021 email next week, which will include the series sign-up information. And if you know someone who has been curious about a plant-based diet, invite them to subscribe to the newsletter so they can get the details about this new free program and don't miss its launch!"
