        "The newest volume of my Latest in Clinical Nutrition DVD series is now out. Order on my website or through Amazon (all proceeds go to the 501c3 nonprofit charity that keeps NutritionFacts.org up and running). It can also now be ordered as a video download.",
        "The last batch of videos from volume 16 just ran out, so running through March I'll be rolling out the videos from this new DVD, volume 17. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share them as gifts, but there is nothing on the DVDs that won't eventually end up free online at NutritionFacts.org. If you'd like the works-more than 30 hours of video\u2013I have a special on my complete DVD collection (also via download).",
        "Here's the list of chapters from the new volume 17 DVD \u2013 a preview of what's to come over the next few months on NutritionFacts.org:",
