        "The current batch of videos from volume 8 are set to run out soon, and so starting this week, and running up until August here on NutritionFacts.org, I'll be rolling out the videos off my new Latest in Clinical Nutrition DVD, volume 9. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share as gifts, but there's nothing on the DVDs that won't eventually end up here for free at NutritionFacts.org.",
