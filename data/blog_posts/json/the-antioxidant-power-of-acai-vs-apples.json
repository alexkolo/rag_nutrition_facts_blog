        "There are so many a\u00e7a\u00ed products on the market now, from frozen pulp in smoothie packs to freeze-dried powder and supplements. How is it eaten traditionally? 'In the Brazilian Amazon, the Indian tribes of the forest cut down the tree and eat the palm heart...then urinate on the rest of the tree to attract a species of palm beetle to lay its eggs inside the tree. Several weeks later, they return to harvest 3\u20134 pounds of beetle grub larvae....' I think I'll just stick to my smoothie pack.",
        "'Despite being used for a long time as food and beverage' in the Amazon, a\u00e7a\u00ed berries have only been researched scientifically since the beginning of this century. A number of years ago, I reviewed that research in my video Clinical Studies on A\u00e7a\u00ed Berries, starting with in vitro studies showing that a\u00e7a\u00ed could kill leukemia cells in a petri dish at levels you might expect to find in the bloodstream after eating one or two cups of a\u00e7a\u00ed pulp and could also cut the growth of colon cancer cells in half.",
        "Unfortunately, as I discuss in my video The Antioxidant Effects of A\u00e7a\u00ed vs. Apples, subsequent published studies have failed to find such benefits for that particular type of colon cancer, a different type of colon cancer, or an estrogen-receptor negative form of breast cancer. An a\u00e7a\u00ed extract did appear to kill off a line of estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer cells, but to achieve that level of a\u00e7a\u00ed nutrients in your breast, you'd have to eat about 400 cups of a\u00e7a\u00ed pulp.",
        "The problem with many of these petri dish studies is that they use concentrations that you could never realistically achieve in your bloodstream. For example, as you can see at 1:48 in my video, a\u00e7a\u00ed berries may exert a neuroprotective effect, blocking the buildup of amyloid fibers implicated in Alzheimer's-but only at a dose reached by drinking about 2,000 cups at one time. They may also have an anti-allergy effect or decrease bone loss-at a mere 1,000 cups a day.",
        "In my previous video Clinical Studies on A\u00e7a\u00ed Berries, I also talked about a clinical study in which subjects were asked to drink less than a cup a day of a\u00e7a\u00ed in a smoothie. They appeared to get significant improvements in blood sugar, insulin levels, and cholesterol. Now, there was no control group and it was a small study, but there'd never been a bigger study trying to replicate it until a study published in 2016.",
        "As you can see at 2:37 in my video, researchers gave subjects the same amount of a\u00e7a\u00ed for the same duration as the previous study, but they found no significant improvements in blood sugars, insulin, or cholesterol. Why did this study fail to show the benefits seen in the first study? Well, this study was publicly funded with 'no conflicts of interest,' while the first study was funded by an a\u00e7a\u00ed company, which always makes you suspect that perhaps it was somehow designed to get the desired result. And, indeed, the participants in that first study were not just given a\u00e7a\u00ed smoothies, but they were explicitly told to avoid processed meat, 'for example bacon and hot dogs.' No wonder their numbers looked better at the end of the month. Now, the new study did find a decrease in markers of oxidative stress in the participants' bloodstreams, a sign of how rich in antioxidants a\u00e7a\u00ed berries can be.",
        "Those who hock supplements love to talk about how a\u00e7a\u00ed consumption can 'triple antioxidant capacity' of your blood. And, if you look at the study they cite, you'll find that the antioxidant capacity of participants' blood did actually triple after eating a\u00e7a\u00ed-but the same or even better tripling was achieved after consuming just plain applesauce, which the researchers used as a control that happens to be significantly cheaper than a\u00e7a\u00ed berries or supplements. You can see the graph at 3:42 in my video.",
        "A new study has shown significant improvements in artery function after eating a\u00e7a\u00ed berries, but are they any more effective than other common fruits and vegetables? You can learn more about that in my video The Benefits of A\u00e7a\u00ed vs. Blueberries for Artery Function.",
