        "We are thrilled to debut our new diversity shirt! We have long stressed the importance of dietary diversity. Each plant family has a unique combination of phytonutrients, which is one of the reasons I developed the Daily Dozen to encourage eating a variety of the very best foods each day for health and longevity. We also continue to share life-saving, life-changing science-based information to communities around the world, which is why everything on our website is free and all of our videos are translated into multiple languages. We're thankful we get to take part in helping to make the world a more healthful place for everyone. All of the proceeds from the sale of our new diversity shirt will support Food Empowerment Project, a nonprofit food justice organization.",

        "My new volume of videos is out today and covers mushrooms, mycotoxins, fasting, bariatric surgery, and more. It is available as a streaming video so you can start watching it immediately.
