        "Why do people who eat more plants get less cancer? The largest prospective study of diet and cancer in history, for example, found that vegetarians had lower levels of all cancers combined. This could be due to what they eat less of:",
        "There are also components of plant foods they are getting more of that can help eliminate excess estrogen; extinguish free radicals; and boost our antioxidant, detoxification, and DNA repair enzymes. What we do eat may be as important as what we don't eat.",
        "The healthiest food is dark green leafy vegetables, which we should ideally eat every day. Greens can improve our eyesight, immune function, athletic performance, and even our physical appearance.",
        "The green pigment itself-chlorophyll-may even intercept carcinogens. See my 2-min. video Eating Green to Prevent Cancer, where which I profile a study entitled  'Effects of Chlorophyll on Low-Dose Aflatoxin in Human Volunteers.' Researchers had people drink a solution of radioactive aflatoxin, the carcinogen that used to be a problem in peanut butter, with or without spinach chlorophyll. Check out the video to see the amazing results.",
