        "In a scathing expose of the USDA's new meat inspection program, the Washington Post quoted a representative from the meat inspectors union, who said:",
        "'pig processing lines may be moving too quickly to catch tainted meat... Tremendous amounts of fecal matter remain on the carcasses. Not small bits, but chunks.'",
        "What about the other white meat?",
        "In the video, Autopsy of Chicken Nuggets, you can see an infographic the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine created to highlight what they consider to be the five worst contaminants in chicken products. In their investigation of retail chicken products in ten U.S. cities, they found fecal contamination in about half the chicken they bought at the store. But with all the focus on what's in chicken products, we may have lost sight on what may be missing-such as actual chicken.",
        "Researchers from the University of Mississippi Medical Center and the Baptist Medical Center recently published an 'autopsy' of chicken nuggets in the American Journal of Medicine. The purpose was to determine the contents of chicken nuggets from two national food chains. Because chicken nuggets are popular among children, the researchers thought that parents should know more about what they may be feeding to their kids.",
        "The nugget from the first restaurant was composed of approximately 50% skeletal muscle, with the remainder composed primarily of fat, blood vessels and nerves, and generous quantities of skin or gut lining and associated supportive tissue. The nugget from the second restaurant was composed of approximately 40% skeletal muscle with lots of other tissues, including bone.",
        "'I was floored,' said the lead investigator. 'I had read what other reports have said is in them and I didn't believe it. I was astonished actually seeing it under the microscope.' I profile some of those other pathology reports in my videos What's in a Burger? and What Is Really in Hot Dogs?",
        "The researchers concluded that since actual chicken meat was not the predominant component of either nugget, the term 'chicken' nugget was really a misnomer.",
        "More on fecal contamination of chicken in Fecal Bacteria Survey, of fish in Fecal Contamination of Sushi, and of pork in Yersinia in Pork. How can that be legal? See Salmonella in Chicken & Turkey: Deadly But Not Illegal.",
        "More on the preservatives in chicken in Phosphate Additives in Meat Purge and Cola and antibiotic contamination in Drug Residues in Meat."
