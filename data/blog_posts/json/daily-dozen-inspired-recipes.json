        "Dr. Greger developed the Daily Dozen using the best available balance of evidence from scientific nutrition research. Rather than being a meal plan or diet in itself, the Daily Dozen is a checklist to inspire you to include some of the healthiest of healthy foods in your everyday routine and encourage you to design more balanced meals. The Daily Dozen is meant to serve as an aspirational minimum, so feel free to add even more whole, plant-based foods throughout your day.",
        "Here are some recipes to help you check off some Daily Dozen boxes.",
        "The Cheesy Broccoli Soup from The How Not to Diet Cookbook is the perfect way to add some cruciferous vegetables to your meals. We eat first with our eyes, and the lovely green broccoli florets against a backdrop of cheesy broth will have you wanting to eat with your mouth, too.",
