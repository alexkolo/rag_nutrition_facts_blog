        "Improving cognitive performance with aromatherapy in young, healthy volunteers is one thing, but how about where it really matters? As I discuss in my video Best Aromatherapy Herb for Alzheimer's, a group of Japanese researchers had a pie-in-the-sky notion that certain smells could lead to 'nerve rebirth' in Alzheimer's patients. Twenty years ago, even simply raising such a possibility as a hypothetical was heretical. Everybody knew that the loss of neurons is irreversible. In other words, dead nerve cells are not replaced, an important factor in neurodegenerative diseases. That's what I was taught and what everyone was taught, until 1998.",
        "Patients with advanced cancer volunteered to be injected with a special dye that's incorporated into the DNA of new cells. On autopsy, researchers then went hunting for nerve cells that lit up in the brains. And, as you can see at 1:14 in my video, there they were: new nerve cells in the brain that didn't exist just days or months before, demonstrating 'that cell genesis occurs in human brains and that the human brain retains the potential for self-renewal throughout life'-something in which we can take comfort.",
        "It still doesn't mean smells can help, though. An aromatherapy regimen of rosemary, lemon, lavender, and orange essential oils was attempted for a month. At 1:43 in my video, you can see the trajectory of the subjects' cognitive function and their ability to form abstract ideas starting six weeks before the treatment. Prior to the aromatherapy regimen, there was a rather steady decline, which was reversed after the aromatherapy. The researchers concluded that aromatherapy may be efficacious and 'have some potential for improving cognitive function, especially in AD [Alzheimer's disease] patients'-all, of course, without any apparent side effects.",
        "I've produced one other video on lemon balm: Reducing Radiation Damage with Ginger and Lemon Balm. We grow lemon balm in our garden. It makes a delicious tea. Give it a try!",
