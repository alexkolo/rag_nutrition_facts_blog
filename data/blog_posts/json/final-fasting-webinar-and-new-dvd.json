        "I knew next to nothing about fasting until I did this deep dive into the medical literature for you. There are, by my count, 1,527 articles on fasting in English-language peer-reviewed scientific journals, and I read every single one of them... so you don't have to!\n \nI've compiled all the best science into 41 videos which will drip out on NutritionFacts.org over the next few years, but for those who don't want to wait, I am holding a series of webinars to go through them all at once and answer questions.",
        "The first webinar in July covered intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding, and water-only fasting for weight loss. You can get the digital download here. The second webinar, Fasting for Disease Reversal, is coming up this weekend and while registration is already closed, the digital download will be available next week. UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who attended the webinar. If you missed it, the digital download is available here: https://drgreger.org/collections/downloads.",
        "The final webinar \u2013 Fasting and Cancer \u2013 will be October 25 at 2pm ET (my birthday!). In this session, I will focus on fasting for cancer as both an adjunct to chemotherapy and as a potential treatment in and of itself. I will also cover fasting for detoxing from chemical pollutants and pros and cons of using VSED-voluntarily stopping eating and drinking-to take control of the end of your life. Read more about it here.",

        "My new DVD is out today and is available as a streaming video so you can start watching it immediately. As you can see below, the main focus is on intermittent fasting, with the first set of my 41 fasting videos. All of these videos will eventually be available for free online over the next few months, but if you don't want to wait, you can watch them all streaming right now.",
