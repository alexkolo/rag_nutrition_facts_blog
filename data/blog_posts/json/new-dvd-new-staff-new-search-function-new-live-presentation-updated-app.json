        "The new batch of upcoming videos is done and it includes a new 6-part video series on vitamin D. The last time I covered this controversial topic was 4 years ago, during which time 15,950 scientific papers on the topic were published. Having an influential vitamin D supplement lobby doesn't help matters, not to mention the highly lucrative vitamin D lab testing industry. Then there's the sunscreen trade, the dermatologist faction, and a multi-billion dollar tanning industry. Did you know there are more tanning salons than Starbucks? With so many powerful commercial interests trying to manipulate the message, it can be hard to get at the truth. But that's what you have me for! Stay tuned:",
        "I also have new videos queued up over the next few months on turmeric, protein, Parkinson's disease, osteoporosis, meat hormones, and natural treatments for morning sickness. If you don't want to wait, all of these videos are available now as a digital download as part of my new Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 31 (all proceeds go to charity). It can also be ordered as a physical DVD.",
        "The current batch of videos from volume 30 are about to run out on NutritionFacts.org. So, starting next month and running until August, I'll roll out the videos from this new DVD, volume 31. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share them as gifts, but there is nothing on the DVDs that won't eventually end up free online here at NutritionFacts.org. If you'd like the works-50+ hours of video-you can get the complete DVD collection.",
        "Here's the full list of chapters from the new volume 31 DVD-a preview of what's to come over the next few months on NutritionFacts.org:",
        "Order my new DVD at DrGreger.org/dvds or through Amazon. It can also be ordered as a video download at DrGreger.org/downloads.",
        "If you were a regular supporter, you'd already be a vitamin D expert by now, having already received the new DVD. I come out with new DVDs every 9 weeks. If you'd like to automatically receive them before they're even available to the public, please consider becoming a monthly donor.",
        "Anyone signing up on the donation page to become a $15 monthly contributor will receive the next three DVDs for free (as physical DVDs, downloads, or both-your choice), and anyone signing up as a $25 monthly contributor will get a whole year's worth of new DVDs. If you're already signed up and didn't receive your volume 31 yet, please email DVDhelp@NutritionFacts.org and we'll make everything all better.",
        "If you'd rather just watch all the videos online as they launch, but would still like to support my work of helping to educate millions about healthy eating, you can make a tax-deductible donation to my 501c3 nonprofit organization NutritionFacts.org using a credit card, Bitcoin, a direct PayPal link, or by sending a check to 'NutritionFacts.org' PO Box 11400, Takoma Park, MD 20913.",
        "Please join me in congratulating and welcoming the latest additions to the NutritionFacts.org team, our new Development Director, Volunteer Director, Social Media Director, and Volunteer Coordinator.  We're so excited they will all will be joining us this month.Find out more about them on our About page.",
        "We're growing by such leaps and bounds that we're going to need all the help we can get!",
        "Most of the work on NutritionFacts.org gets done by volunteers. One major project has been to translate videos into other languages. We have more than 80 volunteer translators translating into more than 30 languages! The first video in the last batch had 27 translations the day it went live. But how can you tell which videos are in which languages? Our new search function!",
        "Thanks to Christi, our rockstar web developer and CTO, the search function on NutritionFacts.org has been totally revamped. Click on the search box and you can now sort and filter results by title, date, type and language. Want to know which videos are available in Spanish, Hebrew or Chinese? Now you can!",
        "What we need now are more translators. If you know another language please consider chipping in and translating some of your favorite videos to help save lives around the world. Sign up at https://nutritionfacts.org/volunteer",
        "You'll note we're still in desperate need of volunteer article retrievers as well. If you're a student or faculty at an institution that grants you academic journal access, please consider helping us sift through the scientific literature. Please note it may take a few weeks for our hopefully-soon-to-be-hired Volunteer Director to get back to you, but please consider signing up today to help translate or sift so she or he can hit the ground running.",
        "Over the years, people have recorded my live presentations with their phones and camcorders, but they've never really been captured professionally... until now! Thanks to Viva and the College of Naturopathic Medicine, on my recent trip to London my new How Not to Die talk was recorded and edited by a videography team and it's available free at http://bit.ly/londontalk. It's similar to the talk I gave at Google but modified for a UK audience. The British suffer from the same leading causes of death, just in a slightly different order.",
        "Dr. John McDougall has graciously offered to allow me to post a U.S. version recorded at his Advanced Study Weekend. As soon as we get our Social Media Director on board to do its promotion justice, I will post it. Until then, I think the London recording is the best capture of my most powerful presentation to date. I hope you'll help me share it with the world.",
        "Thanks to the volunteer efforts of John Slavick, a major update has been made to the Android version of my Dr. Greger's Daily Dozen app. Now you can track, graph, and chart your progress over time-how cool is that?",
        "Wish the iPhone version were that awesome too? If you're an app developer we need your help! If you want to make the Android app even better or help the iPhone app catch up, the Daily Dozen app is an open-source project, meaning anyone with the know-how can play a part in its future development.  Check out the latest details here on how to get started.",
        "Finally, let me apologize if the website has been slow for you over the last few weeks. We've had so much traffic recently the servers have even crashed a few times! To deal with the surge in interest, rest assured we're not only adding new staff but new bandwidth as well.",
        "It's a good problem to have!"
