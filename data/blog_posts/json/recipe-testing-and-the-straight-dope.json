        "Just a few months to go before the How Not to Die Cookbook comes out in December! Want a sneak peek at some of the recipes? The publisher printed up some 2018 How Not to Die Cookbook wall calendars featuring 12 recipes from the book (collector's edition! :) and offered to mail them to the first 500 people who agree to make the recipes and share their creations on social media with the hashtag #HowNotToDie.",
        "Sign up here to be one of the first to get your hands on these all-Green-Light-ingredient recipes and help spread the word. The calendar is free, but you have to be among the first 500 to sign up so don't delay! Note this offer is for US mailing addresses only.",
        "In my nutrition work, I'm known for sifting through mountains of data in the context of massive conflicts of corrupting commercial interests to get at the truth. So it's no wonder that people come to me asking about other divisive health topics. So once in a while I'll cover controversial non-nutrition subjects like Should We All Get Colonoscopies Starting at Age 50? or fun topics like Laughter as Medicine or Music as Medicine.",
        "One of the most common questions I get is about the use of cannabis, both edible and smokable. Like in the field of nutrition, there's gobs of internet misinformation floating around on all sides of the debate, and so I decided to take the topic on. I ended up making 20 videos on it, which I'll dribble out at one a month or so on NutritionFacts.org. They're all done now, though, and so for those interested in the topic I thought I'd put on a live webinar to share them all at once. So here's your chance to cut through the haze and see what the science actually says.",
        "Here's all the topics I'm going to cover in the 3 hour webinar:",
        "They will eventually all go up on NutritionFacts.org (the last is scheduled for November 2019) but if you don't want to wait 2 years, you can get it all now by joining me in this live webinar to get all your questions answered. For more info on signing up, go here.",
        "If you, or anyone you know is addicted to marijuana, it is best to undergo treatment in a residential addiction treatment. This will not only prevent the patient from going into the jaws of death due to drugs, but also provide information on how to cope with the relapse.",
        "Speaking of webinars, one of my favorite docs is giving a free webinar today at 2pm ET on 'Bringing Plant-Based Nutrition into the Clinical Practice,' a must for any medical professionals or students out there who want to incorporate these powerful tools into your practice. And it's free and open to the public, thanks to the American College of Lifestyle Medicine.",
        "Register for it here.",
        "Looking for a way to show your support of NutritionFacts.org this Fall? Check out our new baseball t-shirts, and tees and totes featuring our popular 'Plants are the Best Medicine' design here.",
        "They're only available for a limited time, though. The fundraiser ends October 5th.",
        "All proceeds go to keeping NutritionFacts.org alive and thriving.",
        "Spanish is the second most common spoken language in the world, which is why we were so ecstatic to finally get the Spanish version of NutritionFacts.org up (just click on the Spanish toggle on the bottom of any page on the site or go to https://nutritionfacts.org/es/). The most common, though, is Mandarin. So we're super-excited to announce the addition of our new Chinese Social Media Manager, Hailey Chang. This is your tax-deductible donations to NutritionFacts.org hard at work! Hailey currently lives in Hong Kong and will be focused on expanding our current social media platforms, Miaopai and YouKu, and creating a NutritionFacts.org presence on Weibo (kind of like China's Twitter).",
        "Also, please welcome Dustin Kirkpatrick, our new Graphic Designer! You can read more about him on our Meet the Team page. We're so excited to be constantly expanding our reach and it's all thanks to your support!",
