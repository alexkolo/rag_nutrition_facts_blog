        "The current batch of videos from volume 10 are about to run out, so starting next week and running into 2013 I'll be rolling out the videos off my new Latest in Clinical Nutrition DVD, volume 11. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share as gifts, but there's nothing on the DVDs that won't eventually end up online free at NutritionFacts.org.",
        "The Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 11 DVD is available now (and also available on Amazon). If you're in need of catching up, I've packaged the first ten volumes into a 12-disc DVD set (also on Amazon).",
        "Here's the list of chapters from the new volume 11 DVD - a preview of what's to come here on NutritionFacts.org:",
        "If you haven't already, you can subscribe for free to my videos at bit.ly/nutritionupdates and watch my 2012 presentation 'Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death,' in which I explore the role diet can play in preventing, treating, and even reversing our top 15 killers, at: bit.ly/uprootingdeath"
