        "The same diet that helps regulate hormones in women may also reduce exposure to endocrine-disrupting pollutants.",
        "Fibroids are the most common benign tumors in women. They can grow to a foot in diameter and affect the majority of women before they hit menopause. Although fibroids tend to be asymptomatic, when symptoms do occur, they tend to manifest as heavy menstrual bleeding-so much so that women may get anemic and experience a lot of pain. So, what can women do? I discuss this in my video The Best Diet for Fibroids.",
        "Up to half go into surgery and get their entire uterus removed. 'Although hysterectomy is generally considered a safe operation, complications occur in a significant proportion of patients' and, obviously, you can't have kids any more. The alternative is a variety of hormone-modulating drugs, which can shrink the fibroids and provide relief, but many of these drugs have significant side effects, like bone loss, so you really don't want to be taking them for more than a few months. What's the bottom line? 'There is currently no evidence to support the routine use of medical treatment in women with uterine fibroids.' No wonder many women turn to 'complementary and alternative treatments...including exercise, diet, herbs, and acupuncture.'",
        "Women who exercise seven or more hours a week do seem to have lower risk of having fibroids than women who exercise less than around 20 minutes a day, but exercise has never been put to the test for treating fibroids. Likewise, to date, there isn't a single randomized controlled trial of acupuncture for the treatment of fibroids to help guide us.",
        "In terms of herbs, there are two Asian herbal preparations that show promise-a five-herb combo called Guizhi Fuling and a Malaysian ten-herb formula that contains 'secret ingredients' that must not be that secret since they're just listed in the study, as you can see at 1:50 in my video-and they seemed to work as well as a leading drug. The problem is that traditional Asian herbal remedies may contain a few extra ingredients, like arsenic, mercury, and lead, which have been detected in most of the samples tested from Asian market and health food store shelves, and not just a little. Some, apparently, had really toxic amounts. So, these two Asian herbal preparations 'may reduce fibroid size, but there is insufficient evidence to support the efficacy or safety of these treatments.' And, certainly, don't try to apply caustic herbs internally, as this can lead to scarring, stenosis, and ulceration.",
        "Well, what about diet? In one of the largest studies of diet and fibroids, fibroid tumors were 'associated with beef and ham consumption, whereas high intake of green vegetables seems to have a protective effect.' The researchers figured that the 'association between levels of estrogen, diet, and breast and endometrial [uterine lining] cancers also may help us understand' why. Indeed, '[f]or breast and endometrial cancers, a direct association with the frequency of consumption of meat and ham was observed...whereas protection was conferred by high intake of vegetables and fruits.' Thus, there may be these shared risk factors between estrogen-responsive malignant tumors, like breast cancer, and estrogen-responsive benign tumors, like fibroids.",
        "We know the presence of fibroids seems to correlate with an increase in the amount of estrogens flowing through your body, for example, and that women eating vegetarian diets have significantly lower levels of excess estrogen. Researchers are using this knowledge to try to explain why there are lower rates of endometrial cancer-that is, lining-of-the-uterus cancer-and possibly breast cancer among vegetarian women, but it could also help explain the fibroid findings. 'The incidence of breast cancer among vegetarian American women (Seventh Day Adventists) is 60 to 80 per cent of the incidence among American women in general, and the incidence among women in Africa and Asia is even lower.' Why might vegetarian women have lower estrogen levels? A famous study in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded that it was their 'increased fecal output, which leads to increased fecal excretion of estrogen,' resulting in lower blood levels. Double the fecal output, in fact, as you can see at 4:07 in my video.",
        "And, you can put it to the test. Maybe the same reason African-American women have more fibroids is the same reason they have worse breast cancer survival: too much estrogen in their bloodstream due to a less than optimal diet. So, researchers designed a study to see what would happen if they were switched to a more plant-based, higher fiber diet. Compared with the Caucasian women, the African-American women started out with much higher estrogen levels, again helping to explain their increased mortality from breast cancer. But, after they were put on a healthier diet, all of their levels came down, 'suggest[ing] that a substantial reduction in breast cancer risk can be achieved' by adopting a diet centered around more whole plant foods. The same also appears to be true for fibroids, especially eating lots of cruciferous vegetables-broccoli, cabbage, and Chinese cabbage-as well as tomatoes and apples.",
        "Women who underwent premature puberty, starting their periods before age 11, may also be at increased risk of fibroids later in life, and we know that higher childhood red meat intake is associated with earlier age of starting one's period, though total protein and animal protein in general may contribute. For example, girls who eat meat tend to start their periods about six months earlier than vegetarian girls. Those who eat meat analogues like veggie burgers and veggie dogs start their periods nine months later on average, and a similar puberty normalizing influence was found with consumption of whole plants foods, such as beans.",
        "It could also be the endocrine-disrupting pollutants that build up the food chain. Researchers took samples of internal abdominal fat from women and found there appeared to be a correlation between the presence of fibroids with the levels of a number of PCBs in their fat. So, does that mean fish-eaters have higher risk of fibroids? Researchers did find a small increase in risk associated with the intake of long-chain omega-3 fats, mostly from 'dark-meat fish consumption,' by which they meant fish like sardines and salmon. This could be because of 'the endocrine-disrupting chemicals commonly shown in fish,' or it could just be a statistical fluke. It would be consistent with the increased risk seen among 'sport-fish consumers.'",
        "Recognizing that diet and endocrine-disrupting persistent organic pollutants have been associated with a variety of gynecologic conditions, including fibroids, researchers looked at consumers of fish fished out of the Great Lakes and found a 20 percent increased risk for every ten years they had been eating the fish. In the most comprehensive study to date, researchers compared pollutant levels in fat samples from women with fibroids to fat liposuctioned out of women without fibroids. They didn't just find higher levels of PCBs in fibroid sufferers, but also long-banned pesticides, like DDT and hexachlorocyclohexane, PAHs, which are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons formed when coal is burned, tobacco is smoked, and meat is grilled, as well as heavy metals, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury. These levels correlated not only to fibroids, but also to seafood consumption or excess body fat. So, the researchers determined that 'shedding excess weight and limiting seafood consumption would confer a protective effect' on fibroid tumor development by minimizing exposure to environmental pollutants as much as possible.",
        "Okay, so a plant-based diet may be best, but is there a plant in particular that has been shown to be particularly powerful?",
