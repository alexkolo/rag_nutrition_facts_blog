        "Each month I transcribe the questions from Dr. Greger's live Q&A's for Facebook and YouTube so when people look at the video description on YouTube, they can see exactly what was covered that month. Previous to volunteering, I would tune in and learn so much! I decided I wanted to volunteer to help, and transcribing was a great way to learn and contribute to the community all at once.",
