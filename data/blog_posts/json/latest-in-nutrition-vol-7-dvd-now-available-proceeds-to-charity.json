        "The current batch of videos from volume 6 are set to run out before Christmas, and so starting December 26, and running through March here on NutritionFacts.org, I'll be rolling out the videos off my new Latest in Nutrition DVD, volume 7. Now that all my videos are posted free online, I wasn't sure there would continue to be interest in the DVDs, but demand continues to grow, so at least for the time being I'll keep them in production. They do give people the opportunity to sneak preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share as gifts, but there's nothing on the DVDs that won't eventually end up here on NutritionFacts.org.",

        "I hope it will help folks re-dedicate themselves to living and eating healthier in the New Year."
