        "In January we launched the Evidence-Based Eating Guide, which is available for free download here. Today I'm excited to announce that you can now order hard copies of the guide at-cost over on DrGreger.org. The guide is a run-down of my practical tips in booklet form, including summaries of my Traffic Light system and Daily Dozen checklist, as well as tips for putting them into practice.",
        "As a current subscriber, you can also download digital PDFs: here's an online version, and a fewer-page printable version (best when printed single-sided).",
        "Now that there are physical copies, hopefully you'll see stacks in a doctor's office near you!",

        "The Gianna Simone interview was so popular I thought I'd start sharing some of my interviews to pass along to curious friends and family. Here's a recent article in the Hong Kong Tatler and an interview on the Elite Man Podcast.",
        "Speaking of spreading the message, I'm currently planning my 2020 speaking tour.

        "I'm back to doing monthly Q&As live from my treadmill, and April 25 is the next date.",
