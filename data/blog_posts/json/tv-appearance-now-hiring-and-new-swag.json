        "You asked for more merch, and we answered! We're rolling out new items on the store at DrGreger.org and celebrating with a flash sale. (As always, all proceeds go directly to support NutritionFacts.org). One of the requests has been for organic and US-made shirts, so check out the new designs here. Fill this vibrant new tote bag with all of your greens, beans, and berries. And slap our new stickers onto your laptop, water bottle, or bike.",
