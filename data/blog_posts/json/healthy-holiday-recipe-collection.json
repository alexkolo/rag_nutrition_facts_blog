        "This soup is packed with Daily Dozen ingredients, feel free to add some greens and beans for even more Daily Dozen servings!",
        "I love sweet potatoes, one of the healthiest foods on the planet. The purple ones are the best, and you can usually find them at Asian markets and specialty natural groceries. They're so good I send them out in the mail as holiday gifts. After all, what is more comforting on a wintry day than a nice, warm, steamy sweet potato? Here's a recipe for a stocking stuffer you can stuff.",
        "One of my favorite comfort foods. This warm, savory dish is just as flavorful with mashed cauliflower instead of the sweet potato topping, so mix it up if the mood strikes.",
        "Rather than starchy, boring bread cubes, the stuffing for this dish is made with my Basic BROL, combined with onion, celery, kale, and cranberries. To mix it up, try swapping in any combination of cooked whole grains with beans in place of the Basic BROL.",
        "Enjoy these Cinnamon Baked Apples on their own, pair them with nice cream, or top with cashew cream for dessert. Serve these Baked Apples over cooked oatmeal for a tasty breakfast.",
        "These 5 ingredient treats are quick and easy to whip up. They will satisfy your sweet tooth while checking off some Daily Dozen boxes. Double the batch and make enough for the whole week!",
        "Do you want to see Dr. Greger in the kitchen? Check out:",
