        "Study subjects ate two very similar meals: One had a whole\u2013grain roll, a raw apple, and jam, so there was more fiber and more chewing, while the other meal had white bread, jelly, and cooked apples, so less fiber and less chewing. Then, the researchers measured the halitosis compounds in the participants' breath at two hours after the meal and then again at eight hours. Bad breath levels dropped even after the low-fiber meal, but they dropped significantly more after the higher-fiber meal and stayed down even eight hours later, as you can see in the graph below and at 2:38 in my video.",
        "The reason a high-fiber diet may improve periodontal disease may be the fiber, the lower saturated fat intake, or just the chewing-or perhaps another possibility. Maybe it's the nitrate-containing vegetables. We know 'the ingestion of dietary nitrate'-in the form of greens and beets-'has been proven to exert many beneficial and clinically relevant effects on the general health,' including maintaining good blood flow and reducing inflammation in general. So, might improved circulation to the gums and anti-inflammatory effects benefit periodontal patients?",
        "Let's find out. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigated the repeated consumption of lettuce juice? Why lettuce juice? That sounds so unappealing! Not to worry, though. 'To improve patient acceptance,' the lettuce juice and the placebo juice were seasoned with a chamomile-honey flavor and sweetened with an artificial sweetener. (That sounds even worse!)",
        "But, the lettuce juice concoction worked. 'This clinical intervention trial demonstrated an attenuating effect of dietary nitrate on gingival inflammation.' You can see the results graphically below and at 4:00 in my video. In the placebo group, most of their teeth (about 60 percent) had no gingivitis, but 40 percent did have mild gingivitis and there was almost no moderate gingivitis. After drinking placebo lettuce juice for two weeks, there was no real change, as you might expect. In the lettuce group, they started out a bit worse; about half of their teeth had mild or moderate gum disease. But, then, after two weeks of actual lettuce juice, there were significant improvements. There was no more moderate disease, the mild disease rates were cut in half, and three-quarters of their teeth had no gingivitis at all.",
        "But it's true. Nutrition is neglected in dental school, just like in medical school, and, 'in most cases, courses in nutrition education were taught by biochemists, and only a few individuals (hired part-time or on an ad hoc basis) had training in applied nutrition.' It's really not rocket science, or is it? Get it? (Rocket is another name for arugula, an excellent source of dietary nitrite!) Dietary nitrate is hard to 'beet!'"
