        "The very first of the 4,990 citations in How Not to Diet relates to the stunning fact that it takes an estimated average of seventeen years before evidence from scientific research is incorporated into day-to-day clinical practice. I don't want you to have to wait that long. Nearly 200,000 scientific papers were published on nutrition over the past year, more than 500 new articles a day. Please help us sift through all that science, so you... don't have to!",
        "There are some people who will never change. If they want to smoke cigarettes or go sky diving, it's their body, their choice. But I think most people are just confused. They want to live long, healthy lives, want to take better care of their families, but are bombarded by billion dollar industries bent on sowing confusion in hopes people will just throw up their hands and eat whatever's put in front of them. But the good news is that we have tremendous power over our health destiny and longevity-the vast majority of premature death and disability is preventable with a healthy enough diet and lifestyle. The science is in, but it's being drowned out by commercial interests that may not have our family's best interests at heart. I hope you consider me a partner in the struggle to get at the truth.",
        "Today is the start of our annual end-of-year fundraising drive. Year after year, more than half of our entire annual operating budget has been raised around these final few weeks of the year. So we count on your giving-season generosity to make a tax-deductible donation to keep NutritionFacts.org going and growing.",
        "I may be the face of NutritionFacts.org, but there's a veritable army of volunteers and now more than a dozen staff behind the scenes. They help me churn through the thousands of studies a week to stay on top of the science, so we can bring you daily videos and articles on the latest in evidence-based nutrition. This is only possible because of you. I don't think people understand that annual access to even single academic databases like Web of Science can cost up to nearly $50,000. But every year, thousands of people step forward and make donations large and small to express appreciation for our work. Hundreds have even signed up to be monthly donors, which helps ensure a predictable steady stream of support. Please 'root' for the facts by helping us fill the carrot! It's a numbers game; even a single dollar can help.",
        "On the Donate Page you can make a tax-deductible donation using a credit card, Bitcoin, transferring stock, or by sending a check to 'NutritionFacts.org' PO Box 11400, Takoma Park, MD 20913. (Federal employees may donate through the CFC workplace giving program with designation number 26461.)",
        "We publish new videos and articles five days a week on NutritionFacts.org, and now we have more ways for you to find them, more ways for this life-changing, life-saving information to reach as many people as possible. Find us now on Google News and Apple News.",
        "Evidence-Based Weight Loss\nIn his newest live presentation, Dr. Greger offers a sneak peek into his new book How Not to Diet.",
        "Alternate-Day Intermittent Fasting Put to the Test \nDoes every-other-day-eating prevent the metabolic slowing that accompanies weight loss or improve compliance over constant day-to-day calorie restriction?",
        "Does Intermittent Fasting Increase Human Life Expectancy?",
        "Alternate-day modified fasting is put to the test for lifespan extension.",
        "Every month now I do Q&As live from my treadmill, and December 26 is the day.",
        "You can now find links to all of my past live YouTube and Facebook Q&As right here on NutritionFacts.org. If that's not enough, remember I have an audio podcast to keep you company at https://nutritionfacts.org/audio."
