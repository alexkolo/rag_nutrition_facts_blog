        "Note from Dr. Greger: In short, we found detectable amounts of lead in samples of Frontier, KAL, and Whole Foods brand nutritional yeast, but the lead levels were so low that they all comply with the exceedingly (and justifiably) strict California Prop 65 standards. Still, I advise pregnant women who eat more than a third of a cup a day on a regular basis choose a different brand. No detectable lead levels were found in Bob's Red Mill, Bragg, Dr. Fuhrman, Red Star, or NOW Foods brand nutritional yeast.",
        "Nutritional yeast has grown in popularity and is being introduced into many new dishes and recipes. It has a nice 'cheesy' flavor and texture that can be used in sauces and soups or sprinkled over salads and popcorn. Dr. Greger recently covered how the beta glucan fiber in nutritional yeast can modulate our immune system and help to maintain our body's defense against pathogens (See Dr. Greger's video on Nutritional Yeast to Prevent the Common Cold). It seems beta glucans can be found in many foods, including mushrooms, which have been shown to boost immunity as well.",
        "A safety concern arose when Dr. Greger was notified that California's prop 65 warning stickers were found on packages of nutritional yeast, suggesting there's something in it exceeding cancer or reproductive safety limits. It turns out the problem was lead. There are many contaminants in the environment and in our food supply, even found in our children, which is probably why California has such strict guidelines on contamination. For example, California considers candies with lead levels in excess of 0.10 parts per million (ppm) to be excessively contaminated. State law requires products that contain more than half of a microgram of lead per daily serving to carry a label warning consumers. Could nutritional yeast carry lead levels this high?",
        "Bob's Red Mill  \u2013 Test report shows no detectable lead (<0.01 ppm).",
        "Bragg \u2013 Test report shows no detectable lead (< 0.01 ppm).",
        "Dr. Fuhrman \u2013  Test report shows no detectable lead (< 0.01 ppm).",
        "KAL \u2013 Test report shows lead levels at 0.011 ppm. It would take seven tablespoons a day to exceed the MADL.*",
        "NOW Foods \u2013 Test report shows no detectable lead (< 0.01 ppm).",
        "Red Star \u2013 Test report shows no detectable lead (< 0.01 ppm).",
        "Whole Foods \u2013 Test report shows lead levels at 0.012 ppm. It would take six tablespoons a day to exceed the MADL.*",
        "So what do all those numbers mean? None of the brands tested exceeded California prop 65 standards. No matter what brand, consuming a typical serving (2 tablespoons) per day is still well within safe limits.  I will certainly continue to include the stuff in my diet. Dr. Neal Barnard once said, 'It's not about ALL foods in moderation, it's about healthy foods in moderation. Broccoli is great, but you don't want to just eat broccoli. Kids exercising is wonderful, but you don't want them to exercise all the time.'",
