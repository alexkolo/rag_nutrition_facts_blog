        "'I've been a proud volunteer at NutritionFacts for many years now! I started on the article retrieval team and now respond to comments on the Facebook page and help out with video review. I find it rewarding to contribute to an organization that highlights and shares such important nutrition research. This information should be accessible to all, and I believe that one day whole food, plant-based nutrition will be a fundamental component of standard healthcare. By volunteering, I know that I'm helping manifest that change.",
        "I adore grapes and matcha! But one of my favourite recipes is a morning BROL bowl, based on Dr. Greger's recipe, which has replaced standard oatmeal. I heat a cup of BROL with soy milk and then spice it with cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves, and then add ground flaxseed, walnuts, amla powder, and blueberries. Top it with some hemp hearts, and you'll be fueled for hours!'",
