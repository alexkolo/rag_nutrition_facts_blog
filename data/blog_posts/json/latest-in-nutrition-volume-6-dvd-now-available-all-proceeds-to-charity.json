        "The genesis of NutritionFacts.org dates back to more than a decade ago. Like most doctors, I went into medicine because I wanted to help people, but found myself in some hospital-based practice often dispensing drugs to counteract the side-effects of other drugs I had originally prescribed just to ease symptoms or tweak some risk factor. Meanwhile, bed after hospital bed was filled with people with preventable conditions-emphysema, diabetes, heart disease. I wanted to get to the root cause of the problem; I yearned to practice medicine on a broader scale.",
        "So I started traveling the country speaking at medical schools, hospital grand rounds, and community groups about preventive and lifestyle medicine. Maxing out at 40 talks a month, I (and my family!) soon realized that this perpetual speaking tour was unsustainable. So I started writing books and, five years ago, started recording an annual Latest in Clinical Nutrition DVD, scouring the world's scholarly literature for the most interesting, practical, and groundbreaking science published over the last 12 months on how best to feed ourselves and our families to prevent, treat, and even reverse chronic disease.",
        "Last year, one of the DVDs caught the attention of the Jesse and Julie Rasch Foundation, who, to help fulfill part of their public health mission, offered to put all of my DVDs online. And thanks to them, a year later NutritionFacts.org was born. The site launched August 2011 preloaded with videos from the first four volumes of my Latest in Nutrition DVD series, and over the last two months has been featuring a new daily video from volume 5, the last of which just went up on Friday. So today we're unveiling the first video off the new DVD. Eventually (by the end of the year), all videos off of volume 6 will be up on the site, but if you want a sneak peek at what's to come, would rather watch them straight through, or want to share them as gifts you can purchase the Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 6 DVD now or through Amazon.",
