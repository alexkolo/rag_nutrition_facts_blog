        "The most extensive report on diet and cancer in history is constantly being updated with all the new research. As I discuss in my video The Palatability of Cancer Prevention, in its update on colorectal cancer a few years ago, various meats were implicated, including processed meat as 'a convincing cause of colorectal cancer,' which is its highest level of evidence that 'effectively means 'beyond reasonable doubt.'' More recently, processed meat was confirmed as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization. The main message was that 'the best prevention of colorectal cancer is the combination of higher physical activity with a fibre-rich and meat products poor diet.' A decrease by half a turkey sandwich's worth of meat might lower the total number of colorectal cancer cases by approximately 20 percent. There are several implications of this cancer guideline update, but a paper in the industry publication Meat Science decided 'to focus on the consumer side of the story, since every consumer is a patient and vice-versa at some point in the future.' But chronic disease need not be invariably a consequence of aging.",
        "'Although the epidemiological evidence for the relationship between colorectal cancer risk (at least!) and processed meats intake cannot be denied,' the Meat Science authors suggest further research. For example, compare the risk of consuming meat to other risky practices-alcohol, lack of physical activity, obesity, and smoking. Compared to lung cancer and smoking, maybe meat won't look so bad!",
        "Consumers, however, probably won't even hear about the cancer prevention guidelines. 'Consumers today are overloaded with information....It is thus probable that the dissemination of the [World Cancer Research Fund's] update on colorectal cancer drowns in this information cloud.' And, even if consumers do see it, the meat industry doesn't think they'll much care.",
        "For many consumers in the Western world, 'the role of healthfulness, although important, is not close to taste satisfaction in shaping their final choice of meat and meat products...It is hence questionable that slightly revised recommendations based on the carcinogenic effects of meat consumption will yield substantial changes in consumer behavior.'",
        "Doctors and nutrition professionals feed into this patronizing attitude that people don't care enough about their health to change. A classic paper from The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, a leading journal, scoffed at the idea that people would ever switch to a 'prudent diet,' reducing their intakes of animal protein and fat no matter how much cancer was prevented. 'The chances of reducing consumptions of fat, protein foods, or indeed of any food to a significant extent to avoid colon cancer are virtually nil.' Consider heart disease. We know we can prevent and treat heart disease with the same kind of diet, but the public won't do it. '[T]he diet,' they said, 'would lose too much of its palatability.'",
        "'The great palatability of ham,' in other words, 'largely outweighs other considerations...[although] health and wellbeing are increasingly important factors in consumer decisions.' A 1998 Meat Science article feared that '[u]nless meat eating becomes compatible...with eating that is healthy, wholesome, and safe, it will be consigned to a minor role in the diet in developed countries during the next decade.' That prediction didn't quite pan out. Looking at a graph of total meat consumption per person over the last 30 years or so, intake rises and rises. In 1998, when that Meat Science article worrying about the next decade of meat consumption was published, we see intake rise even further. It does then seem to kind of flatten out before it starts falling off a cliff. Indeed, meat consumption dipped down about 10 percent  but has surged back up. Still, millions of Americans are cutting down on meat.",
        "So don't tell me people aren't willing to change their diets. Nevertheless, we continue to get diluted guidelines and dietary recommendations, because authorities are asking themselves, 'What dietary changes could become acceptable?' rather than just telling us what the best available science says and letting us make up our own minds about the cancer risk as we feed ourselves and our families.",
        "How Much Cancer Does Lunch Meat Cause? Good question-watch the video!",
        "Can simply cutting down on meat consumption extend our lifespan? Find out in Do Flexitarians Live Longer?. For my overview on cancer prevention, check out How Not to Die from Cancer.",
        "I think the role of health authorities is to share with patients the pros and cons of all the options and let the patients, their families, and their doctors decide together what's right for them. I've produced a number of videos on this issue, including:"
