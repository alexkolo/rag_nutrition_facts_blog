        "Despite the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's (USPSTF's) expert panel's recommendation to delay routine mammography screening until age 50, there may have been an increase in the rates of women in their 40s getting mammograms, likely due to the media attention paid to the shift in guidance.",
        "European standards recommend mammograms every few years from age 50, and the American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends annual screening from age 45 and switching to every other year from age 55.",
        "The Cochrane Collaboration, a highly-respected bastion of evidence-based medicine, determined there did not appear to be any significant mortality benefit from mammograms, asserted that the 'available data certainly do not support the popular idea that [breast cancer] screening saves lives,' and concluded that 'the time has come to re-assess whether universal mammography screening should be recommended for any age group.' It also identified the ACS as a political organization with financial conflicts of interest, as it has ties to companies associated with the multibillion-dollar mammogram industry.",
        "Perceived benefits of regular mammography include halving the risk of dying from breast cancer, which may save the lives of about 1 in 12 women. In reality, risk of dying from breast cancer regardless of screening is less than most women think and the reduction in riskfrom screening is much less, with about 5 women in 1,000 dying from breast cancer without screening and 4 in 1,000 dying with screening.",
        "For every life saved by mammography, as many as two to ten women are overdiagnosed and unnecessarily turned into breast cancer patients, introducing all of the attendant harms of chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery, without the benefits.",
        "Unnecessary radiation treatments may kill as many as are saved, and radiation treatments to the chest increase risk of dying from heart disease and lung cancer.",
        "The Cochrane Collaboration review: 'The small probability that a woman may avoid a breast cancer death must be weighed against the more likely scenario that she may have a false-positive result and possible unnecessary follow up testing (including invasive testing); a false-negative result, with false reassurance or delayed diagnosis; or most critically, diagnosis and treatment of cancer that would otherwise not have threatened her health or even come to her attention.'"
