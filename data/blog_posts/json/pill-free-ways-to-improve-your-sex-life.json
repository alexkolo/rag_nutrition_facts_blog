        "'Sex is important to health,' according to the Harvard Health Letter. 'Frequent sexual intercourse is associated with reduced heart attack risk.' But, as I discuss in my video Do Men Who Have More Sex Live Longer?, that seems to be the perfect case of reverse causation. They're implying that more sex leads to healthier arteries, but isn't the opposite more likely-that is, healthier arteries lead to more sex? Blood flow in the penis is so reflective of blood flow elsewhere that penile Doppler ultrasound can predict cardiovascular disease. However, low frequency of sexual activity may predict cardiovascular disease in men independently of erectile dysfunction. This suggests that sex may be more than 'just fun' and may also be therapeutic, or at least so says an editor of the Journal of Sexual Medicine and colleagues in discussing whether or not 'frequent sexual activity can be prescribed' to improve general health. In men, they suggest it's because more sex means more testosterone.",
        "When men have sex, they get a big spike in testosterone levels in their blood, but, interestingly, in contrast, they don't get a testosterone boost when they masturbate, as you can see at 1:21 in my video. This may be because 'testosterone increases with competitive success,' like if you win a sports game. While sex 'is not usually regarded as a competitive event...one's mental state following coitus could nevertheless be something like that of a winner,' as opposed to the mental state after masturbation.",
        "As you can see at 2:00 in my video, the spike in sex hormones in the blood is so great that men's beards actually grow faster on days they have sex. And, since low testosterone levels are associated with increased risk of mortality, this could help explain the health benefits of having sex.",
        "So, do men who have more sex actually live longer? I searched Pubmed for sexual activity and longevity and found a study supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, titled 'Sexual activity and longevity of the southern green stink bug'-clearly an example of our taxpayer dollars hard at work. I was less interested in whether or not screwworms live up to their namesake and more interested in a study on sex and death, in which the objective was 'to examine the relation between frequency of orgasm and mortality.' The researchers found that men with 'high orgasmic frequency' appeared to cut their risk of premature death in half and, apparently, the more, the better: There was an associated 36 percent drop in mortality odds for every additional 100 orgasms a year. 'Conclusion: Sexual activity seems to have a protective effect on men's health'-but, apparently, not if you cheat. 'Unfaithfulness in men seems to be associated with a higher risk of major cardiovascular events,' like heart attacks and strokes. 'Extramarital sex may be hazardous and stressful because the lover is often younger...[and] a secret sexual encounter' may be more stressful.",
        "In a large autopsy series, the majority of cases of sudden death during sex occurred in men during extramarital intercourse. The absolute risk is low-'only one out of 580 men might be expected to suffer a sudden death attributable to sexual intercourse'-but for those at high risk, research shows that '[s]ex in familiar surroundings, in a comfortable room temperature, and with the usual partner adds less stress to the heart' and may be safer.",
        "Speaking of safe sex, you thought drinking and driving was bad? 'While it is generally assumed that sexual behavior happens in parked cars, there is little discussion...in the research literature of sexual activity in moving vehicles.' About one in five college students report engaging in sex while driving, nearly half while going more than 60 miles an hour. Researchers suggest maybe this is something students should be warned about in health class.",
        "When done right, though, love may protect your lover's life. Given the benefits of sexual activity, 'intervention programmes could also be considered, perhaps based on the exciting 'At least five a day' campaign aimed at increasing fruit and vegetable consumption-although the numerical imperative may have to be adjusted.'",
        "What are some pill-free ways to improve your sex life? Exercising, quitting smoking, not drinking too much alcohol, not weighing too much, and eating a healthy diet. But what does it mean to 'eat a healthy diet'? As I discuss in my video Best Foods to Improve Sexual Function, heart-healthy lifestyle changes are sex-healthy lifestyle changes, which have been demonstrated in studies from around the world, including in women (for whom there is sadly a dearth of research about in the biomedical literature). 'Sexual function in women is significantly affected' by coronary artery disease, atherosclerotic narrowing of blood flow through our arteries, including the arteries that supply our pelvis. So, high cholesterol may mean 'lower arousal, orgasm, lubrication, and satisfaction,' and the same holds for high blood pressure.",
        "Given this, putting women on a more plant-based diet may help with sexual functioning.   Researchers found that improvements in female sexual function index scores were related to an increased intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and beans, and a shift from animal to plant sources of fat. The same for men: a significant improvement in international Index of Erectile Function scores. In fact, the largest study on diet and erectile dysfunction found that each additional daily serving of fruits or vegetables may reduce the risk of ED by 10 percent. But why? It may be due to the anti-inflammatory effects. Two years on a healthier diet resulted in a significant reduction in systemic inflammation, as indicated by reduced levels of C-reactive protein. Fiber itself may play an anti-inflammatory role. Those who eat the most fiber tend to have significantly lower levels of inflammation in their bodies, as you can see at 2:06 in my video. The opposite was found for saturated fat, 'associated with an increased likelihood of elevated CRP', C-reactive protein levels.",
        "We're used to seeing changes in inflammatory markers over weeks, months, or years, but people don't realize that the level of inflammation in our bodies can change after only a single meal. For example, there's a pro-inflammatory signaling molecule in our bodies called interleukin 18, thought to play a role in destabilizing atherosclerotic plaque. As such, the level of interleukin 18 in the blood ' is a strong predictor' of cardiovascular death.",
        "What would happen if you fed people one of three different types of meals: sausage-egg-butter-oil sandwiches, cheeseless pizza with white flour crust, or the same cheeseless pizza but with whole-wheat crust? Within hours of eating the sausage sandwich, interleukin 18 levels shot up about 20 percent, an effect not seen after eating the plant-based pizza. In contrast, those eating the whole food, plant-based pizza made with the whole-wheat crust had about a 20 percent drop in interleukin 18 levels within hours of consumption, reinforcing dietary recommendations to eat a diet high in fiber and starches, and low in saturated fat to prevent chronic diseases.",
        "But the billions in profits are in pills, not plants, which is why the pharmacology of the female orgasm has been studied ever since 1972 when a researcher at Tulane University implanted tubes deep within the brain of a woman so he could inject drugs directly into her brain and was able to induce repetitive orgasms. A man who had electrodes placed into similar parts of his brain was given a device for a few hours that allowed him to press the button himself to stimulate the electrode. He pressed the button up to 1,500 times.",

        "What effect might that inflammation directly following an unhealthy meal have on our artery function? Check out my three-part endotoxins series starting with The Leaky Gut Theory of Why Animal Products Cause Inflammation.",
