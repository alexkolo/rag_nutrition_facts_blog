The current batch of videos from volume 7 are set to run out soon, and so starting next week, and running through May here on NutritionFacts.org, I’ll be rolling out the videos off my new Latest in Clinical Nutrition DVD, volume 8. The DVDs give folks the opportunity to sneak preview videos months ahead of time, watch them all straight through, and share as gifts, but there’s nothing on the DVDs that won’t eventually end up here for free at NutritionFacts.org.

The Latest in Clinical Nutrition volume 8 DVD is available for purchase now or through Amazon.

Here’s the list of chapters off the new DVD, a preview of what’s to come on NutritionFacts.org:

Getting to be a good time to start Spring cleaning our diets!
