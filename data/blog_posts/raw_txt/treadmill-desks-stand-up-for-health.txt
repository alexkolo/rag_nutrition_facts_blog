A few months ago the New York Times ran a piece reiterating the hazards of prolonged sitting, which is associated with a shorter lifespan–even in those who exercise regularly. Our bodies were built to move.

My 2-min. video Standing Up For Your Health is my contribution to the subject. In fact, I’m walking on the treadmill desk I feature in the video as I speak! (well, write). I’m now up to 17 miles a day! (though at only 2.5 mph).

It’s important to keep in mind, though, that what we eat may be even more important. See:
