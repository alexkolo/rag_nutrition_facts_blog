Show your support of NutritionFacts.org with exclusive new products in our spring fundraiser. Step into summer with our new T-shirt and tank top and enjoy your green tea with a NutritionFacts.org tumbler. They’re only available for a limited time, through May 9. 

All proceeds support the continued work of NutritionFacts.org. 

 

 

 

Every month until recently I’ve done Q&As live from my treadmill. Now that I’ve finished the draft of my new upcoming book, I’m excited to say the Q&As are back and today is the day.

You can now find links to all of my past live YouTube and Facebook Q&As right here. If that’s not enough, remember I have an audio podcast to keep you company at https://nutritionfacts.org/audio.

In health,

Michael Greger, M.D.
