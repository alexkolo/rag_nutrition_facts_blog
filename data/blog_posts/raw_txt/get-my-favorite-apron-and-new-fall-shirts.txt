You may remember the fun broccoli apron I wore in my “In the Kitchen” videos (here and here). These aprons are back by popular demand, along with a fun new t-shirt and sweatshirt, designed by our talented summer intern (thank you, Bryan!). 

Support the continued nonprofit work of NutritionFacts.org and look cruciferocious at the same time! This limited-time fundraiser runs through October 4. Get your swag at http://bit.ly/NutritionFactscollection.
